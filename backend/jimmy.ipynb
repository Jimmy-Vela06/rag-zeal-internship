They gain great depth of knowledge with the technology and business problems of the company they work for', 'Consultants get brought in when the existing approach is not working, must bring their own expertise and processes, and be relentlessly focused on delivery \\n\\nProgramming is Only Part of It…\\nFor ALL professional computer programmers of any type, there’s a lot more to the job than just one’s programming skills\\x0b\\nCommunication is the number one complement to a good developer.  Do not wait to develop your presentation and business communication skills!\\nAs we will examine in a bit, the type and amount of communication required is the key difference-maker between being an in-house developer/contractor and a consultant\\x0b\\nTime organization, self motivation and business dynamics aer always important\\x0b\\nThere are satellite “technical” skills that are very important:  estimation, work break down, debugging, training/mentoring, etc.\\n\\n\\n… there’s also paperwork!  Yay!\\nThe difference between coding your own projects for fun and coding professionally will usually have to do with “the business”.  Many environments have an us-vs-them mentality between the technologists and business people\\x0b\\nThe touchpoint between these two camps is the software development process being used (Scrum, SAFE, Waterfall, etc.)\\nOrganizations with a good working relationship between these two sides have very lightweight processes based on interactions and trust\\nOrganizations with a bad working relationship here will favor high process and lots of formalized, ritual communication\\x0b\\nOften the hardest part of a project is not the technical details or the hands-on-keyboard coding, but navigating these social interactions to make sure you’re building the right thing and telling people how it’s going\\n', 'We Rescue Failing Software Projects\\nAs Consultants, we rescue failing software projects.  When the stuff we’ve just been talking about breaks down and stops producing enough business value for the time and money invested, consultants are brought in to right the ship\\x0b\\nThis doesn’t mean our clients are bad programmers, or bad business men, or incompetent or anything like that.  These social systems and processes evolve over time, and it can be difficult or impossible to change them from within\\x0b\\nSome examples:\\nHow a client’s quest for accurate estimation led to nothing ever getting done (the 10% rule)\\nHow to spend $1.5mm to root cause a <$10,000 outage\\nAnd then how not to do anything with the information\\nHow to spend more than a million dollars on software without ever reaching the requirements gathering phase\\n\\n\\nHow do we do it?\\nWe bring our own pods – lean, carefully composed teams that have their own process and working agreements\\x0b\\nAs outsiders we can challenge the existing process and stay above local politics\\x0b\\nWe cut out middle management.  Everyone on the team has deliverables and works to achieve the goals and tech leadership interacts directly with Zeal business leadership\\x0b\\nAs a software company, we have better hiring and training processes and the ability to retain good developers through difficult project scenarios\\x0b\\nWe are perceived as (and strive to be) subject matter experts\\n', 'Agility is the Key\\nIn practice, agile is the only working “methodology” for developing software.  Other processes can work for project planning and management but for development itself agile is king.\\x0b\\nThe principles of Agile are:\\x0b\\nIndividuals and interactions over processes and tools\\nWorking software over comprehensive documentation\\nCustomer collaboration over contract negotiation\\nResponding to change over following a plan\\x0b\\nIterative is the approach to refining something, it is relevant for code of course, but also for requirements, processes, relationships…  everything!\\n\\n\\n\\nOkay, back on topic now\\nSo let’s review.  In brief…\\x0b\\nConsultants are brought in when a project is going badly or is outside the comfort zone of the organization\\x0b\\nConsultants cannot show up and provide “more of the same”, they have to bring their own, working process and teams\\x0b\\nConsultants are subject matter experts and can shift long-held approaches and attitudes\\nIf we can’t, we can leverage our functional process to deliver business value in spite of environmental challenges\\x0b\\nConsultants have to be able to bridge the gap between the business and technologists with communication and more efficient process\\n\\n\\n\\nBridging the Communication Gap\\nBecause of the nature of their respective tasks, business and engineering speak two very different languages, and language drives thought, so in some ways they think differently\\x0b\\nTo have an effective technical communication you need:  high accuracy, specific details, logical justification and fluency with the appropriate terminology\\nNone of these things are of very high priority in a non-technical communication though…  some of them are even counterproductive!\\x0b\\nMost people naturally “project” the way their own mind works onto people around them\\nThis is an effective shortcut that lets us function out in the world\\nBut when people don’t live up to our expectations, problems emerge\\n“How dare you not act like the imaginary version of you I made up in my head!”\\x0b\\n', 'The Consultant Metagame\\nBesides the differences in mindset and day-to-day interactions, there are some higher level differences between consultants and the other kinds of developer as well:\\x0b\\nYou will experience many codebases and technologies.  Consulting is like wearing heavy training weights for your professional development chops\\x0b\\nYou have two different stakeholders which must be handled differently (the client and Zeal)\\x0b\\nYou have to onboard quickly and efficiently while demonstrating business value\\x0b\\nYou may work multiple projects at the same time\\x0b\\n\\n\\nHigh Stakes Accountability\\nOur clients have many reasons to be very mindful and conscious of our business value delivery:\\x0b\\nThey have usually already spent money and not been successful\\nWe are proposing a different approach\\nConsultants are not cheap\\x0b\\nBecause of this, consultants are always under a high pressure to deliver\\x0b\\nCompleting tickets, finishing story points…  these things only matter insofar as they allow us to deliver business value to production.  We can’t hide in process\\x0b\\n\\n\\nSales is not a bad word\\nAs a consultant, you are much closer to the sales pipeline than other kinds of developer.  YOU are the product that Zeal sells to our clients\\x0b\\nYour client interactions (even routine ones) have a sales component to them – your presentability, demeanor and what you have to say all impact our ability to retain the client and continue working on their projects\\x0b\\nThe best consultants embrace this.  There is room in a consulting company for sound technologists who are less comfortable in this way, but their advancement opportunities are fewer and their ceiling is lower\\n', 'How Do Consultants Get Paid?\\nThere are two main contract structures commonly-used in consulting:\\nFixed Bid:  We agree to deliver a certain thing for a certain amount of money\\x0b\\nTime and Materials:  We bill based on our hours worked and review project status regularly with the client to continue\\nAt any point in the project, a consultant must be prepared to answer these questions:\\nFixed Bid:  Are we on track to finish by a particular date?\\nTime and Materials:  What have we achieved so far/recently?  What will achieve in the next time increment?\\x0b\\n\\nSo, in Summary…\\nYou have to be really good at programming – able to quickly acclimate to a new codebase, find the appropriate touchpoints and start making changes\\x0b\\nYou can’t be reliant on process to deliver – you have to think of the big picture, interact with your team intelligently and work towards the larger objective, not get caught up in the day-to-day paperwork\\x0b\\nPeople trust you more, but have higher expectations of you\\x0b\\nYou have to be a business polyglot – you will learn the essentials of many different industries, styles of business and ways of storing business data and each project will have a unique set of challenges and requirements here\\x0b\\nYou have to constantly work to bridge the gap to the business:  understand their real needs and wants; communicate your needs, expectations and progress; and keep them engaged with the development process throughout the cycle\\n', 'Why Be a Regular Old Developer Then?\\nYou like long-term stability and the ability to deep dive on a single thing (technology and business domain) for a long time\\x0b\\nYou are extremely attached to a single tech stack\\x0b\\nYou favor a particular industry or type of business and passionately want to work in that field\\x0b\\nYou don’t like starting new jobs and meeting new groups of people and enterprises\\x0b\\nYou want a job that becomes easier over time as you acclimate to it and that you can settle into\\n\\n\\nDo You Want to be a Software Consultant?\\nIf you want to level up your programming quickly \\x0b\\nNew challenges excite you and keep you engaged in your work.  You want to continue to grow as you work\\x0b\\nDoing the same thing for a long time seems boring or limiting\\x0b\\nYou’re a solid communicator, or want to become one.  You think customer service is an important part of a technical job\\x0b\\nYou want to learn how to do it the right way\\x0b\\nYou want to work for a software company with a software culture but still explore other business domains\\n\\nZeal IT Consultants\\nWhatever you do,\\ndo it with Zeal.\\n', 'What is Generative AI and RAG?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAI\\nAI is not new.

Everything in the  universe  only \\nexists because it is in relationship to everything else. Nothing \\nexists in isolation. We have to stop pretending we are individuals \\nthat can go it alone. \\n\\n— M A R G A R ET  WHEATLEY \\n\\nHow on earth did I get in here?\" I kept asking myself in those \\n\\nearly days as an overwhelmed first-year student at Harvard \\n\\nBusiness School. \\n\\nThere wasn\\'t a single accounting or finance class  in my back \\nground. Looking around me, I saw ruthlessly focused young men \\nand women who had undergraduate  degrees  in business.  They\\'d \\ngone on to crunch numbers or analyze spreadsheets in the  finest \\nfirms  on  Wall  Street.  Most  were  from  wealthy  families  and  had \\npedigrees and legacies and Roman numerals in their names. Sure, \\nI was intimidated. \\n\\nHow was a guy like me from a working-class family, with a lib \\neral arts degree and a couple years at a traditional manufacturing \\ncompany,  going  to  compete  with  purebreds  from  McKinsey and ', \"been computing business data in their cribs? \\n\\nIt was a defining moment in my career, and in my life. \\nI  was  a  country boy from  southwestern  Pennsylvania,  raised \\nin  a  small,  hardworking  steel  and  coal  town  outside  of Latrobe \\ncalled  Youngstown.  Our  region  was  so  rural  you  couldn't  see \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c4 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nanother  house  from  the  porch  of  our  modest  home.  My  father \\nworked in the local steel mill; on weekends he'd do construction. \\nMy mother  cleaned  the  homes  of the  doctors  and  lawyers  in  a \\nnearby town.  My brother  escaped  small-town  life  by way of the \\narmy; my sister got married in high school and moved out when I \\nwas a toddler. \\n\\nAt HBS,  all  the  insecurities  of my youth  came  rushing  back. \\nYou see, although we didn't have much money, my dad and mom \\nwere  set on  giving me the kind  of opportunities  my brother and \", \"pushed me and sacrificed everything to get me the kind of educa \\ntion  that  only the well-to-do  kids  in  our town  could  afford.  The \\nmemories  rushed  back  to  those  days  when  my  mother  would \\npick me up in our beat-up blue Nova at the bus stop of the private \\nelementary  school  I  attended,  while  the  other  children  ducked \\ninto limos and BMWs. I was teased mercilessly about our car and \\nmy polyester clothes and fake Docksiders—reminded daily of my \\nstation in life. \\n\\nThe experience was a godsend in many ways, toughening my \\nresolve and fueling my drive to succeed. It made clear to me there \\nwas a hard line between the haves and the have-nots. It made me \\nangry to be poor. I felt excluded from what I saw as the old boys' \\nnetwork. On the other hand, all those feelings pushed me to work \\nharder than everyone around me. \\n\\nHard work, I reassured myself, was one of the ways I'd beaten \\nthe odds and gotten into Harvard Business School. But there was \\nsomething  else  that  separated  me  from  the  rest  of my  class  and \", \"before  I  arrived  in  Cambridge  that it  seemed  many of my peers \\nhad not. \\n\\nAs a kid, I caddied at the local country club for the homeown \\ners  and their children living in the wealthy town next to mine. It \\nmade me think often and hard about those who succeed and those \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cBecoming a Member of the Club \\n\\n5 \\n\\nwho  don't.  I made an  observation  in those days that would alter \\nthe way I viewed the world. \\n\\nDuring those long stretches on the links, as I carried their bags, \\nI  watched how the  people who  had  reached  professional  heights \\nunknown to my father and mother helped each other. They found \\none another jobs, they invested time and money in one another's \\nideas, and they made sure their kids got help getting into the best \\nschools, got the right internships, and ultimately got the best jobs. \\nBefore  my  eyes,  I  saw proof that  success  breeds  success  and, \\nindeed, the rich do get richer. Their web of friends and associates \\nwas  the  most  potent  club  the  people  I  caddied  for  had  in  their \", 'was  isolation  from  the kind  of people  that  could  help  you make \\nmore  of yourself. \\n\\nI came to believe that in some very specific ways life, like golf, \\nis a game, and that the people who know the rules, and know them \\nwell, play it best and succeed. And the rule in life that has unprece \\ndented power is that the individual who knows the right people, \\nfor the right reasons, and utilizes the power of these relationships, \\ncan become a member of the \"club,\" whether he started out as  a \\ncaddie or not. \\n\\nThis realization came with some empowering implications. To \\nachieve your goals in life, I realized, it matters less how smart you \\nare, how much innate talent you\\'re born with, or even, most eye-\\nopening to me, where you came from and how much you started \\nout with. Sure all these are important, but they mean little if you \\ndon\\'t understand one thing: You can\\'t get there alone. In fact, you \\ncan\\'t get very far at all. \\n\\nFortunately, I was hungry to make something of myself (and, \\nfrankly,  even  more  terrified  that  I\\'d  amount  to  nothing).  Other ', \"friends in the caddy yard. \\n\\nI  first  began  to  learn  about  the  incredible  power  of relation-\\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c6 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nships from Mrs.  Poland.  Carol  Poland was married to the owner \\nof the big lumberyard in  our town, and her son,  Brett, who was \\nmy age, was  my friend.  They went to  our  church. At the time,  I \\nprobably wanted to be Brett (great athlete, rich, all the girls falling \\nover him). \\n\\nAt the club, I was Mrs. Poland's caddie. I was the only one who \\ncared  enough,  ironically,  to  hide  her  cigarettes.  I  busted  my \\nbehind to help her win every tournament. I'd walk the course the \\nmorning before to  see where the tough  pin  placements were.  I'd \\ntest the speed of the greens. Mrs. Poland started racking up wins \\nleft  and  right.  Every  ladies  day,  I  did  such  a  great  job  that  she \\nwould brag about me to her friends. Soon, others requested me. \", \"I'd caddie thirty-six holes a day if I could get the work, and I \\nmade sure I treated the club caddie-master as if he were a king. My \\nfirst  year,  I  won  the  annual  caddie  award,  which  gave  me  the \\nchance to caddie for Arnold Palmer when he came to play on his \\nhometown  course.  Arnie  started  out  as  a  caddie  himself  at  the \\nLatrobe Country Club and went on to own the club as an adult. I \\nlooked up to him as a role model. He was living proof that success \\nin  golf,  and  in  life,  had  nothing  to  do  with  class.  It  was  about \\naccess  (yes,  and  talent,  at  least  in his  case).  Some  gained  access \\nthrough birth or money. Some were fantastic at what they did, like \\nArnold  Palmer.  My  edge,  I  knew,  was  my  initiative  and  drive. \\nArnie was inspirational proof that your past need not be prologue \", '\\nFor years I was a de facto member of the Poland family, split \\nting  holidays  with  them  and  hanging  out  at  their  house  nearly \\nevery day. Brett and I were inseparable, and I loved his family like \\nmy own.  Mrs.  Poland made  sure I  got  to know everyone  in  the \\nclub  that  could  help  me,  and  if she  saw me  slacking,  I\\'d  hear  it \\nfrom her. I helped her on the golf course, and she, in appreciation \\nof my efforts and the care I bestowed upon her, helped me in life. \\nShe  provided  me  with  a  simple  but  profound  lesson  about  the \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cBecoming a Member of the Club \\n\\n7 \\n\\npower of generosity. When you help  others, they often help you. \\nReciprocity  is  the  gussied-up  word  people  use  later  in  life  to \\ndescribe this ageless principle. I just knew the word as \"care.\" We \\ncared for each other, so we went out of our way to do nice things. ', 'realize that first semester at business school that Harvard\\'s hyper-\\ncompetitive, individualistic  students had it all wrong.  Success in \\nany field, but especially in business, is about working with people, \\nnot against them. No tabulation of dollars and cents can account \\nfor  one  immutable  fact:  Business  is  a  human  enterprise,  driven \\nand determined by people. \\n\\nIt wasn\\'t too far into my second semester before I started jok \\ningly reassuring myself, \"How on earth  did all these other people \\nget in here?\" \\n\\nWhat  many of my fellow  students  lacked,  I  discovered,  were \\nthe  skills  and  strategies  that  are  associated  with  fostering  and \\nbuilding  relationships.  In  America,  and  especially  in  business, \\nwe\\'re  brought  up  to  cherish  John  Wayne  individualism.  People \\nwho consciously court others to become involved in their lives are \\nseen as schmoozers, brown-nosers, smarmy sycophants. \\n\\nOver the years, I learned that the outrageous number of mis-\\nperceptions clouding those who are active relationship-builders is ', 'is done properly. What I saw on the golf course—friends helping \\nfriends and families helping families they cared about—had noth \\ning to do with manipulation or quid pro quo. Rarely was there any \\nrunning tally of who  did what for whom, or strategies concocted \\nin which you give just so you could get. \\n\\nOver time,  I  came  to  see  reaching  out to  people  as  a way to \\nmake a difference in people\\'s lives as well as a way to explore and \\nlearn and enrich my own; it became the conscious construction of \\nmy life\\'s  path.  Once  I  saw my networking  efforts  in  this  light,  I \\ngave myself permission to  practice  it with  abandon  in  every part \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c8 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nof my professional and personal life. I didn\\'t think of it as cold and \\nimpersonal, the way I thought of \"networking.\" I was, instead, con \\nnecting—sharing my knowledge and resources, time and energy, \\nfriends and associates, and empathy and compassion in a contin \\nual effort to provide value to others, while coincidentally increas ', \"managing transactions, but about managing relationships. \\n\\nPeople  who  instinctively  establish  a  strong  network  of  rela \\ntionships  have  always  created  great businesses. If you  strip  busi \\nness down to its basics, it's still about people selling things to other \\npeople. That idea can get lost in the tremendous hubbub the busi \\nness  world  perpetually  stirs  up  around  everything  from  brands \\nand technology to  design  and  price  considerations  in  an  endless \\nsearch for the ultimate competitive advantage. But ask any accom \\nplished  CEO  or  entrepreneur  or  professional  how they achieved \\ntheir  success, and  I  guarantee you'll  hear very little  business jar \\ngon. What you will mostly hear about are the people who helped \\npave their way, if they are being honest and not too caught up  in \\ntheir own success. \\n\\nAfter  two  decades  of successfully applying  the  power  of rela \\ntionships in my own life and career, I've come to believe that con \\nnecting  is  one  of  the  most  important  business—and  life—skill \", \"with  people  they  know  and  like.  Careers—in  every  imaginable \\nfield—work  the same way. Even our overall well-being and sense \\nof happiness,  as  a library's worth  of research  has  shown,  is  dic \\ntated  in  large  part by the  support  and guidance  and love we  get \\nfrom the community we build for ourselves. \\n\\nIt took me a while to figure out exactly how to go about con \\nnecting with others.

At  every  stage  in  my  career,  I \\nsought  out  the  most  successful  people  around me  and  asked for \\ntheir help and guidance. \\n\\nI first learned the value of mentors from a local lawyer named \\nGeorge Love.

My  ambitions  were \\nsown  in  the  fertile  soil  of George  and Walt's  rambling  business \\nescapades, and ever since, I've been on the lookout for others who \", \"business leaders, store owners, politicians, and movers and shak \\ners  of all  stripes,  I  started  to  gain  a  sense  of how  our  country's \\nmost  successful  people  reach  out  to  others,  and  how they invite \\nthose people's help in accomplishing their goals. \\n\\nI learned that real networking was about finding ways to make \\nother people more successful. It was about working hard to give more \\nthan you get. And I came to believe that there was a litany of tough-\\nminded principles that made this softhearted philosophy possible. \\nThese  principles  would  ultimately  help  me  achieve  things  I \\ndidn't think I was capable of.

That  aid was \\nnever  in more  dire need than  during my first job  out  of business \\nschool at Deloitte & Touche Consulting. \\n\\nBy conventional standards, I was an awful entry-level consult \", \"is what happened when  I  found myself on  my first project, hud \\ndled  in  a  cramped windowless  room  in  the  middle  of suburbia, \\nfiles  stretching from floor to ceiling, poring over a sea of data with \\na few other first-year consultants.  I  tried;  I  really did.  But I just \\ncouldn't. I was convinced boredom that bad was lethal. \\n\\nI was clearly well on my way to getting fired or quitting. \\nLuckily,  I  had  already  applied  some  of the  very rules  of net \\nworking that I was still in the process of learning. In my spare time, \\nwhen  I  wasn't  painfully  attempting  to  analyze  some  data-ridden \\nworksheet, I  reached out to  ex-classmates, professors, old bosses, \\nand  anyone who  might  stand to  benefit from  a  relationship  with \\nDeloitte.

But  my  supervisors,  with \\nwhom I had already developed relationships and who were aware \\nof all my extracurricular activities, had another idea. Together, we \\ncooked  up  a job  description  that  previously did not  exist  at the \\ncompany. \\n\\nMy mentors gave me a $150,000 expense account to do what I \\nhad  already  been  doing:  developing  business,  representing  the \\nfirm  with  speaking  engagements,  and  reaching  out  to  the  press \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cBecoming a Member of the Club \\n\\n11 \\n\\nand business world in ways that would strengthen Deloitte's pres \\nence  in  the  marketplace.

Everything you could want in a job. \\n\\nWhile my career was in full throttle, in some ways it all seemed \\nlike a lucky accident. In fact, for many years, I couldn't see exactly \\nwhere my professional trajectory would take me—after Deloitte, a \\ncrazy quilt of top-level jobs culminating in my founding my own \\ncompany.  It's  only today,  looking  in  the  rearview mirror,  that it \\nmakes enormous sense. \\n\\nFrom  Deloitte,  I  became the youngest  chief marketing officer \\nin the Fortune 500 at Starwood Hotel & Resorts.

I zigged and zagged my way to \\nthe  top.  Every time  I  contemplated  a  move  or  needed  advice,  I \\nturned to the circle of friends I had created around me. \\n\\nAt first I tried to draw attention away from my people skills for \\nfear that they were somehow inferior to  other more \"respectable\" \\nbusiness  abilities.  But  as  I  got  older,  everyone from well-known \\nCEOs and politicians to college kids and my own employees came \\nto  me  asking for  advice  on how to  do  those  things  I  had  always \\nloved  doing.  Crain\\'s  magazine  listed  me  as  one  of the  forty top \\nbusiness  leaders  under  forty,  and  the  World  Economic  Forum \\nlabeled  me  as  a  \"Global  Leader  of  Tomorrow.\"  Senator  Hillary \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c12 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nClinton asked me to  use my connecting skills to  raise money for ', 'Friends and CEOs of Fortune 500 companies asked if I could help \\nthem throw more intimate dinner parties for their lead prospects \\nand clients in key regions  of the country.

I wanted the same thing at their age. \\n\\n\"So you want the  inside  scoop,\" I  respond. \"Fair  enough.  I\\'ll \\n\\nsum up the key to success in one word: generosity.\" \\n\\nThen  I  pause, watching the  faces  of the kids  in the  crowd  as \\nthey look  back  at  me  with  quizzical  expressions.  Half the  group \\nthinks  I\\'m  about  to  tell  them  a joke;  the  other  half thinks  they \\nwould  have  been  better  off getting  a  beer  rather  than  attending \\nmy talk. \\n\\nI go on to explain that when I was young, my father, a Pennsyl \\nvania  steelworker,  wanted  more  for  me  than  he  ever  had.  And \\nhe  expressed  this  desire  to  a  man  whom  up  until  that  moment ', 'Mr. McKenna liked my dad\\'s moxie and helped me get a scholar \\nship to one of the best private schools in the country, where he was \\na trustee. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cDon\\'t Keep Score \\n\\n15 \\n\\nLater, Elsie Hillman, chairwoman of the Pennsylvania Repub \\nlican Party, whom I first met after she read in the New York Times \\nabout  my  unsuccessful  bid  for  New  Haven  City  Council  in  my \\nsophomore year  at Yale, lent me  money and  advice  and  encour \\naged me to attend business school. \\n\\nBy the  time  I  was  your  age,  I  tell  the  students,  I  had  been \\nafforded  one  of the  best  educational  opportunities  in  the world, \\nalmost purely through the generosity of others. \\n\\n\"But,\" I continue, \"here\\'s the hard part: You\\'ve got to be more \\nthan willing to accept generosity. Often, you\\'ve got to go out and \\nask for it.\" \\n\\nNow I get that look of instant recognition. Almost everyone in \\nthe room has had to reach  out for help to  get a job interview, an ', \"ask. Until you become as willing to ask for help as you are to give \\nit, however, you are only working half the equation. \\n\\nThat's  what  I  mean  by  connecting.  It's  a  constant  process \\nof  giving  and  receiving—of  asking  for  and  offering  help.  By \\nputting  people in  contact with  one another, by giving your time \\nand  expertise  and  sharing  them  freely,  the  pie  gets  bigger  for \\neveryone. \\n\\nThis karma-tinged vision of how things work may sound naive \\nto those who have grown cynical of the business world. But while \\nthe power of generosity is not yet fully appreciated, or applied, in \\nthe halls of corporate America, its value in the world of networks \\nis proven. \\n\\nFor example, I enjoy giving career advice and counseling. It's \\nalmost  a hobby.  I've  done  this  with  hundreds  of young  people, \\nand  I  get  enormous  satisfaction  hearing  from  them  later  on  as \\ntheir careers progress.

To \\nme,  nothing  is  as  infuriating  as  encountering  such  blindness \\nabout how things work. Nor is it, as one might assume, a genera \\ntional  issue.  I\\'ve  gotten  similar reactions  from  people  of all  ages \\nand in all walks of life. \\n\\nA  network functions  precisely because  there\\'s  recognition  of \\nmutual  need.  There\\'s  an  implicit  understanding  that  investing \\ntime  and  energy  in  building  personal  relationships  with  the \\nright people will pay dividends.

It  was  glorified  indentured  servitude,  with  few \\noptions  and  few  opportunities.  Today,  however,  employers  offer \\nlittle loyalty, and employees give none. Our careers aren't paths so \\nmuch  as  landscapes  that are  navigated. We're  free  agents,  entre \\npreneurs, and intrapreneurs—each with our own unique brand. \\n\\nMany people have adapted to these new times with the belief \\nthat  it's  still  a  dog-eat-dog  world,  where  the  meanest,  baddest \", \"the truth. \\n\\nWhere  employees  once  found  generosity  and  loyalty  in  the \\ncompanies we worked for, today we must find them  in a web  of \\nour own relationships. It isn't the blind loyalty and generosity we \\nonce  gave  to  a  corporation.  It's  a  more  personal  kind  of loyalty \\nand  generosity,  one  given  to  your  colleagues,  your  team,  your \\nfriends, your customers. \\n\\nToday, we need each other more than ever. \\nSadly, plenty of people still function as if it were 1950. We have \\na tendency to romanticize independence. Most business literature \\nstill views autonomy as a virtue, as though communication, team \\nwork, and cooperation were lesser values. To such thinkers, inter \\ndependence  is  just  a  variation  of  outright  dependence.  In  my \\nexperience, such a view is a career-killer. \\n\\nAutonomy is a life vest made out of sand. Independent people \\nwho do not have the skills to think and act interdependently may \\nbe  good  individual  producers,  but  they  won't  be  seen  as  good \", \"before too long. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c18 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nLet  me  give  you  an  example.  When  I  was  at  Deloitte,  I  was \\nworking on a project for the largest HMO  in the country, Kaiser \\nPermanente, forcing me to travel between their two headquarters \\nin  San  Francisco  and  Los  Angeles,  and  back  to  my  home  in \\nChicago on the weekend. \\n\\nIt was clear to me early on that I hoped to  use the consulting \\nworld as a gateway into some other field. Since I was in Los Ange \\nles, I wondered how I might begin to create inroads into the enter \\ntainment  industry.  I  wasn't  looking  to  accomplish  anything  in \\nparticular;  I just knew that I  was  interested  in  the  industry,  and \\nwhen the day came to move on, I wanted to break into Hollywood \\nwithout having to deliver some agent's mail. \\n\\nRay Gallo,  my best  friend  from  my undergraduate  days, was \\npracticing law in Los Angeles, so I called him to get some advice. \", 'I can talk to for some advice about breaking into the industry? You \\nknow any people who\\'d be open for a short lunch?\" \\n\\n\"There\\'s  a  guy  named  David  who  I  know  through  mutual \\n\\nfriends who also went to HBS. Give him a call.\" \\n\\nDavid was  a smart entrepreneur doing some creative deals  in \\nHollywood. In particular, he had a close connection with a senior \\nexecutive at one of the studios whom he had also  gone to  school \\nwith. I was hoping I might get a chance to get to know both of them. \\nDavid and I met for a cup of coffee at an outdoor cafe in Santa \\nMonica. He was dressed in very dapper casual L.A. attire. I wore a \\nsuit and tie, befitting the buttoned-down  Midwestern  consultant \\nthat I was at the time. \\n\\nAfter a good deal of back-and-forth, I asked David a question. \\n\"I\\'m  thinking  about  transitioning  into  the  entertainment \\nindustry at some point. Is there anyone you know who you think \\ncould  lend  some  helpful  advice?\"  I  was  a  good  friend  of a  close ', 'our meeting. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cDon\\'t Keep Score \\n\\n19 \\n\\n\"I do know somebody,\" he told me. \"She is a senior executive at \\n\\nParamount.\" \\n\\n\"Great,  I\\'d  love  to  meet  her,\"  I  said  excitedly.  \"Is  there  any \\nchance of arranging a quick introduction? Maybe you could pass \\non an e-mail?\" \\n\\n\"I can\\'t,\" he told me flatly. I was shocked, and my face showed \\nit.  \"Keith,  here\\'s  the  situation.  It\\'s  likely  that  at  some  point  I\\'m \\ngoing  to  need  something from  this  person  or want to  ask  a per \\nsonal favor. And I\\'m just not interested in  using the  equity that I \\nhave with this individual on you, or anyone else, for that matter. I \\nneed to save that for myself. I\\'m sorry. I hope you understand.\" \\n\\nBut I didn\\'t understand. I still don\\'t. His statement flew in the \\nface  of everything  I  knew.  He  thought  of relationships  as  finite, ', 'away, and there was that much less for him. I knew, however, that \\nrelationships  are  more  like  muscles—the  more  you  work  them, \\nthe stronger they become. \\n\\nIf I\\'m going to take the time to meet with somebody, I\\'m going \\nto  try to  make  that  person  successful.  But David kept  score.  He \\nsaw every social  encounter  in  terms  of diminishing  returns.  For \\nhim, there was only so much goodwill available in a relationship \\nand only so much collateral and equity to burn. \\n\\nWhat he didn\\'t understand was that it\\'s the exercising of equity \\nthat builds equity. That\\'s the big \"ah-ha\" that David never seemed \\nto have learned. \\n\\nJack Pidgeon, the headmaster of the Kiski School in southwest \\nern Pennsylvania, where I went to high school, taught me that les \\nson.  He\\'d  built  an  entire  institution  on  his  asking  people  not \\n\"How can you help me?\" but \"How can I help youT \\n\\nOne of the many times Jack came to my aid was when I was a \\nsophomore in college.

But I was young and naive and ready for battle. \\n\\nUnfortunately, we barely had time to don our armor before we \\nwere forced to wave the white flag of surrender. A month into the \\ncampaign,  we  ran  out  of money.  Eight  other  college  kids  and  I \\nwere literally thrown out of our hotel room, which doubled as our \\ncampaign  headquarters,  in  the  middle  of the  night  by a  general \\nmanager who had not been paid in too long a time. \\n\\nWe decided to pack our duffel bags into a rented van, and not \\nknowing  what  else  to  do,  we  headed  to  Washington,  D.C.  We \\ninnocently hoped we could latch onto another campaign. Boy, we \\nwere green. \\n\\nIn the middle of the night, at some anonymous rest stop on the \\nway to Washington, I called Mr. Pidgeon from a pay phone. When \", \"do  what  he  has  done  for  several  generations  of Kiski  alums.  He \\nopened his Rolodex and started making calls. \\n\\nOne  of those  people  he  called was  Jim  Moore,  a  Kiski  alum \\nwho was the former Assistant Secretary of Commerce in the Rea \\ngan administration. By the time our caravan of lost souls made it \\nto D.C, we all had places to stay and we were on our way to get \\nting  summer jobs.  I'm  pretty sure that  Mr.  Pidgeon  had made  a \\nfew similar calls for Jim in his day. \\n\\nMr.  Pidgeon  understood  the  value  of  introducing  people  to \\npeople,  Kiski  boy to  Kiski  boy.  He knew not  only the  impact it \\nwould have on our individual lives, but that the loyalty such acts \\nengender would ultimately reap  rewards for the nearly bankrupt, \\nsmall,  five-building  facility in  southwestern  Pennsylvania  he was \\ntrying to establish. \\n\\nAnd so it has. Jim and I are now on the Board of Directors at \", \"the  school,  today  you'd  barely  recognize  the  place,  with  its  ski \\nslopes, golf course, fine arts  center,  and the  sort of sophisticated \\ntechnology that makes it look like some midwestern MIT. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cDon't Keep Score \\n\\n21 \\n\\nMy point is this:  Relationships are solidified by trust.

You gain trust by asking not what people can \\ndo for you, to paraphrase an earlier Kennedy, but what you can do \\nfor others. \\n\\nIn  other words,  the  currency of real  networking  is  not  greed \\n\\nbut generosity. \\n\\nWhen I look back on all the people who have taught me invalu \\nable lessons about creating lasting relationships—my father, Elsie, \\nmy mentees and the college kids I speak with, Ray, Mr. Pidgeon, the \\npeople  I've worked with—I  come  away with  several  fundamental \\ninsights and observations: \\n\\n1.  Yesterday we  had  the  new  economy.  Today we  have  the  old \\neconomy (again!), and no  one  can  predict what's  going to be \", 'and  trusted  associates  remain.

Congratulations ...\" \\n\\nJob  security?  Experience will  not  save you in  hard times, \\nnor will hard work or talent. If you need a job, money, advice, \\nhelp, hope, or a means to make a sale, there\\'s only one surefire, \\nfail-safe  place  to  find  them—within  your  extended  circle  of \\nfriends and associates. \\n\\n2.  There\\'s  no  need  to  ponder  whether  it\\'s  their  lunch  or  yours. \\nThere\\'s  no  point  in  keeping  track  of favors  done  and  owed. \\nWho cares? \\n\\nWould  it  surprise  you  if  I  told  you  \"Hollywood\"  David ', \"equity he  had  until  he  eventually looked  around  and  discov \\nered there was  nothing  more  to  hoard.

Part of that \\nstrategy, of course, is establishing relationships with the people in \\nyour universe who can help you get where you\\'re going. \\n\\nEvery successful person I\\'ve met shared, in varying degrees, a \\nzeal for goal  setting.

Thirteen \\npercent had goals  but had not written them down. Fully 84  per \\ncent had no specific goals at all, other than to \"enjoy themselves.\" \\nIn  1973, when  the  same  class was  resurveyed, the  differences \\nbetween the goal setters and everyone else were stunning. The  13 \\npercent who had goals that were not in writing were earning, on \\naverage, twice as much as the 84 percent of students who had no \\ngoals at all. But most surprising of all, the 3 percent who had writ \\nten their goals down were earning, on average, ten times as much \\nas the other 97 percent of graduates combined! ', \"My own focus  on  goal  setting  started  early. As  a Yale  under-\\ngrad, I thought I wanted to become a politician, a future governor \\nof Pennsylvania.  (I really was that specific, and that naive.)  But I \\nlearned that the more concrete my goal, the more I could accom \\nplish  toward  it.  In  my  sophomore  year,  I  became  chairman  of \\nYale's  political  union, where  so  many alumni  had cut their teeth \\nbefore going on to careers in politics. When I became interested in \\njoining  a  fraternity,  I  didn't  simply  join  the  first  organization \\navailable to me. I researched which fraternity had the most active \\npoliticians  as  alumni.  Sigma  Chi  had  a  rich  tradition  and  an \\nalumni roster of impressive leaders. But the fraternity wasn't char \\ntered at Yale at that time. So we founded a chapter. \\n\\nEventually I ran for New Haven City Council.

I knew \\nI  needed a focus, a direction that I  could pour my energies  into. \\nAn article by Michael Hammer that I read in business school gave \\nme that focus.

Many of these  people  are doing well, but they \\nare  doing  well  at  something  they don\\'t  enjoy.  How we  got  our \\nselves into such a situation isn\\'t difficult to understand. People get \\noverwhelmed by the decisions they have to make about their jobs, \\ntheir families, their businesses, their futures. There are too many \\nchoices, it seems. We end up shifting our focus to talents we don\\'t \\nhave and careers that don\\'t quite fit. Many of us respond by sim \\nply falling into whatever comes down the pike without ever asking \\nourselves some very important questions.

Most  people \\ndon\\'t. They accept what they \"should\" be doing, rather than take \\nthe time to figure out what they want to be doing. \\n\\nWe all have our own loves, insecurities, strengths, weaknesses, \\nand unique capabilities. And we have to take those into account in \\nfiguring  out where our talents and desires intersect. That intersec \\ntion  is what I  call your \"blue  flame\"—where  passion  and  ability \\ncome together. When that blue flame is ignited within a person, it \\nis a powerful force in getting you where you want to go. \\n\\nI think of the blue flame as a convergence of mission and pas \\nsion  founded  on  a  realistic  self-assessment  of  your  abilities.  It \\nhelps  determine  your  life\\'s  purpose,  from  taking  care  of the  el \\nderly to becoming a mother, from being a top engineer to becom \\ning  a  writer  or  a  musician.

His \\nblue flame, he decided, was the study of Greek mythology. When \\nhe was told there was no such major, he devised his own plan. \\n\\nAfter  graduation, he moved  into  a  cabin  in Woodstock, New \\nYork,  where  he  did  nothing  but  read  from  nine  in  the  morning \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cWhat\\'s Your Mission? \\n\\n27 \\n\\nuntil  six  or  seven  each  night  for five years.  There  isn\\'t  exactly a \\ncareer track for lovers of Greek myth. Campbell emerged from the \\nwoods  a very, very knowledgeable  man,  but he  still  had no  clue \\nwhat  to  do  with  his  life.  He  persisted  in  following  his  love  of \\nmythology anyway. \\n\\nThe people who met him during this time were astonished by \\nhis  wisdom  and  passion.  Eventually,  he  was  invited  to  speak  at \\nSarah Lawrence College. One lecture led to another, until  finally, ', 'a  famous  author  and  professor  of  mythology,  doing  what  he \\nloved, at the same school that had given him his first break. \"If you \\nfollow your bliss, you put yourself on a kind of track that has been \\nthere all the while, waiting for you, and the life that you ought to \\nbe living is the one you are living.\" \\n\\nSo how do you figure out your bliss? \\nCampbell  believed  that  deep  within  each  person,  there\\'s  an \\nintuitive knowledge of what she or he wants most in life. We only \\nhave to look for it. \\n\\nWell, I agree with Dr. Campbell. All good decisions, I\\'m con \\nvinced, come from good information. Deciding on your passion, \\nyour bliss, your blue flame is no different. There are two aspects to \\ngetting  good  information.  One  part  comes  from within you;  the \\nother part comes from those around you. \\n\\n1. Look inside \\n\\nThere  are  many ways  to  conduct  a  self-assessment  of your  goals \\nand  dreams.  Some  people  pray.  Others  meditate  or  read.  Some ', '\\nThe important thing when conducting an internal review is to \\ndo without the constraints, without the doubts, fears, and expec \\ntations of what you \"should\" be doing.

Some are preposterous; others are overly prag \\nmatic. I  don\\'t attempt to censure or edit the nature of the list—I \\nput anything and everything down. Next to  that first list, I write \\ndown  in  a  second  column  all  the  things  that  bring  me  joy  and \\npleasure: the achievements, people, and things that move me. The \\nclues can be found in the hobbies you pursue and the magazines, \\nmovies,  and  books  you  enjoy.  Which  activities  excite  you  the \\nmost, where you don\\'t even notice the hours that pass? \\n\\nWhen I\\'m done, I start to  connect these two lists, looking for \\nintersections, that sense of direction or purpose. It\\'s a simple exer ', \"\\n2. Look outside \\n\\nNext,  ask  the  people  who  know you  best  what  they  think  your \\ngreatest strengths and weaknesses are. Ask them what they admire \\nabout you and what areas you may need help in. \\n\\nBefore  long,  you'll  find  that  the  information  you're  getting \\nfrom your own review and the input you receive from others will \\nlead you to some very concrete conclusions about what your mis \\nsion or direction should be. \\n\\nSome  of the  business  world's  toughest  CEOs  and  entrepre \\nneurs are big believers in this notion of the blue  flame—although \\nthey probably don't call it that. \\n\\nJames  Champy, celebrated consultant and coauthor of Reengi-\\nneering the Corporation, claims that success is first and foremost a \\nmatter of our dreams. In his book The Arc of Ambition, Champy \\nfound that the abilities of successful leaders like Ted Turner, Michael \\nDell, and Jack Welch are less important than the fact that each shares \\na clearly defined mission that drives him in all that he does. \\n\\nWhen Champy asked Michael Dell where he found the ambi \\ntion to build Dell computers, the CEO started to talk about busi \", '\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cWhat\\'s Your Mission? \\n\\n29 \\n\\n\"You know where I think the dream really came from?\" he said. \\nHe  described  driving  to  school  through  the  suburbs  of Houston \\nand  ogling  the  office  buildings  with  their  great  flagpoles.  Dell \\nwanted a flagpole. He wanted that kind of presence. To him, it was \\na symbol of success, and it drove him to  envision starting up his \\nown company before he could legally order a drink. Today, he has \\nthree flagpoles. I\\'ve spoken to  Michael  a number of times  about \\nhis strategy at Dell, and it\\'s amazing how each and every time this \\ndream comes through clearly. \\n\\nHuman  ambitions  are  like  Japanese  carp;  they grow  propor \\ntional  to  the  size  of their  environment.  Our  achievements  grow \\naccording to the size of our dreams and the degree to which we are \\nin touch with our mission. \\n\\nComing  up  with  goals,  updating  them,  and  monitoring  our \\nprogress  in  achieving them  is  less  important,  I  believe, than the ', '\\nDoes that mean a hopeless dreamer could have run GE as well \\nas  Neutron Jack?

He has \\nthe  ability  and  sensibility  that  allows  him  to  walk  into  various \\nindustries and see where the opportunities are.\" \\n\\nDisciplined  dreamers  all  have  one  thing  in  common:  a  mis \\nsion.  The mission  is  often  risky, unconventional, and most likely \\ntough as hell to achieve. But it is possible.  The kind of discipline \\nthat  turns  a  dream  into  a  mission,  and  a  mission  into  a  reality, \\nreally just comes down to a process of setting goals. \\n\\nStep Two: Putting Goals to Paper \\n\\nTurning  a mission into  a reality does not \"just happen.\" It is \\nbuilt like any work of art or commerce, from the ground up.

It requires thought, determi \\nnation, persistence, and faith. \\n\\nThe tool I use is something I call the Networking Action Plan. \\nThe Plan is separated into three distinct parts: The first part is \\ndevoted to  the  development  of the  goals  that will  help  you  fulfill \\nyour mission. The second part is devoted to connecting those goals \\nto the people, places, and things that will help you get the job done. \\nAnd the third part helps you determine the best way to reach out to \\nthe people who will help you to accomplish your goals. \\n\\nIt\\'s  a bare-bones,  straightforward worksheet,  but  it  has  been \\nextraordinarily  helpful  to  me,  my  sales  staff,  and  many  of  my \\nfriends. \\n\\nIn the first section, I list what I\\'d like to accomplish three years \\nfrom  today.  I  then  work  backward  in  both  one-year  and  three-\\nmonth increments to develop mid- and short-term goals that will \\nhelp me reach my mission. Under each time frame, I create an \"A\" ', 'to be three years from now. \\n\\nA close friend, Jamie, offers a good example of how this works. \\nJamie was struggling to find direction in her life. She had gradu \\nated with a Ph.D. in history from Harvard, thinking she\\'d become \\na professor. But she found academia too stuffy. She gave business \\na shot, but found the world of commerce unrewarding. So Jamie \\nspent  several  months  living  in  Manhattan  thinking  about where \\nshe was  going in life, until it occurred to her that what she really \\nwanted to do was teach children. \\n\\nI asked Jamie to give my Networking Action Plan a try. She was \\nskeptical  at first. \"That may be good for MBA types, but I\\'m not \\nsure  it works  for  people  like  me,\"  she  insisted.  Nonetheless,  she \\nagreed to try it. \\n\\nSo  she set about filling out the worksheet. Her \"A\" goal three \\nyears forward was to be a teacher. Her three-year \"B\" goal was to \\nbe  a  teacher  in  a  well-respected  district  located  in  a  place  she \\nwanted to live. Then she filled in his short-term A and B goals. ', \"www.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cWhat's Your Mission? \\n\\n31 \\n\\nIn  ninety  days,  she  wanted  to  be  well  on  her  way  toward \\nbecoming certified as a high school teacher, enrolling in some type \\nof program that would help professionals transition into the  field \\nof education.  In  a year,  she wanted to  be teaching full-time;  she \\nmade a list of some of the best high schools in Manhattan that she \\nmight enjoy working at. \\n\\nIn the second part of the Plan, broken up in similar time incre \\nments, she had to name one or two people for each A and B goal \\nwho she thought could get her one step closer to making her goal \\na reality. \\n\\nJamie  did  her  research  and  found  the  contact  for  a  program \\nthat  places  midcareer  professionals  into  teaching  positions.  She \\nalso  found  out  the  names  of the  people  at  each  of the  best  high \\nschools she had listed who were responsible for hiring. Finally, she \\nfound the number for an organization that provides teaching cer \\ntification  courses. \", \"Within a couple of weeks, Jamie was on her way. She started to \\nsee the symbiotic relationship  between  goal  setting and reaching \\nout to the people who can help us achieve those goals. The more \\nshe accomplished, the bigger her teaching network grew. The big \\nger her teaching network grew, the closer she came to accomplish \\ning her three-year goals. \\n\\nUltimately, the third stage helps you assess which of the strate \\ngies I'll show you in the following chapters will be most successful. \\nWith some people, it will require you cold-call them (which we'll \\ntalk  more  about  later).  Others  you'll  be  able  to  reach  through \\nfriends of friends; still others might best be acquainted through a \\ndinner party or conference.  I'll teach you how to  utilize  all these \\nmethods and more. \\n\\nJamie  is  now a tenured high  school  history teacher in  one  of \\nthe best high  schools  in the country, in Beverly Hills, California. \\nAnd she loves the job. \\n\\nThis  process  can  be  used  by  almost  anyone,  whatever  your \\ncareer.  After  completing  the  worksheet,  you'll  have  a  mission. \", \"www.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c32 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nYou'll  have  the  name  of a flesh-and-blood  person who  can  help \\nyou take the next step  in achieving that mission. And you'll have \\none, or perhaps several, ways to reach out to that person. \\n\\nThe purpose of this exercise is to show that there is a process, a \\nsystem if you will, involved in building a network. It's not magical; \\nit's  not  reserved  for  a  select  few  born  with  an  inherent  gift  for \\nbeing social. Connecting with others really just involves having a \\npredetermined plan and carrying it out, whether you want to be a \\nninth-grade history teacher or start your own business. \\n\\nMoreover, you can apply the worksheet to every aspect of your \\nlife:  to  expand  your  network  of friends,  further  your  education, \\nfind  a lifelong partner, and search for spiritual guidance. \\n\\nOnce you have your plan, post it in a place  (or places) where \\nyou will see it on a regular basis.

I \\nlike to keep some variation of it in my Palm to remind myself reg \\nularly what I need to be accomplishing, and whom I need to reach \\nout to. A few years  ago, I  laminated  a small version of the  sheet \\nand kept it in my wallet. \\n\\nBut your goals  must be in writing. Have the conviction to put \\nyour  intentions  to  paper. An  unwritten wish  is just  a  dream.  In \\nwriting, it's a commitment, a goal. \\n\\nHere are a few other criteria to consider when filling out your \\n\\nNetworking Action Plan, or NAP: \\n\\n• Your goals must be specific. Vague, sweeping goals are too broad \\nto  be  acted  upon.  They must be  concrete  and  detailed.  Know \\nwhat steps you'll take to achieve your goal, the date by which it \\nwill be accomplished, and the measurement you'll use to gauge \\nwhether you've achieved the goal  or not.  I tell my salespeople \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cWhat's Your Mission? \", '33 \\n\\nthat setting a goal like \"I\\'m going to have my best quarter ever\" \\nis not enough. Will they make $100,000 or $500,000? \\n\\n•  Your  goals  must  be  believable.  If you  don\\'t  believe  you  can \\nreach them, you won\\'t. If your goal is to increase the revenues \\nof your business to five million dollars in a year, and you only \\nachieve revenues of one million, you\\'re setting yourself up for \\nfailure.  Instead,  set your  goal  at half a million  dollars  for the \\nyear—and beat the heck out of it. \\n\\n•  Your  goals  must  be  challenging  and  demanding.  Step  out  of \\nyour comfort zone; set goals that require risk and uncertainty. \\nAnd when you achieve your goal, set another one. One of the \\nbest  salesmen  I\\'ve  ever met  is  a man  my father knew named \\nLyle, who sold books door-to-door. He would set annual sales \\ngoals for himself, write them  down, and place them wherever \\nhe  could:  in  his  wallet,  on  his  refrigerator,  in  his  desk. ', 'he\\'d simply write down another one. The man was never satis \\nfied.  What matters is the goal setting, Lyle would say, not the \\ngoal  getting.  He  may have  been  the  only  door-to-door book \\nsalesman  in  Pennsylvania—or  anywhere  else,  for  that  mat \\nter—who died a rich man. \\n\\nNext, take ACTIOM It\\'s called a Networking Action Plan for a \\nreason.

I  took  a  Vipassana  meditation  retreat \\nwhere I sat for ten hours each day for ten days straight—in silence. \\nFor a guy like me, who can't shut up, it was torture. I wondered if \\nI might fritter away all my time thinking. I wondered if I should go \\nback to Pennsylvania and find a smaller pond to inhabit. \\n\\nDuring that time I wrote a detailed twelve-page mission state \\nment asking such  questions  as What are my strengths? What are \\nmy  weaknesses?  What  are  the  various  industry  opportunities \\navailable to me?  I listed the venture capitalists I wanted to meet, \", \"companies that I admired. I left all my options open: teacher, min \\nister,  politician,  chief  executive  officer.  For  each  potential  new \\ndirection, I filled out a Networking Action Plan. \\n\\nWhen  everything was  laid  out,  I  reached  out to  my personal \\nboard of advisors. I didn't have the qualifications to be appointed \\na CEO with a major corporation. Yet when I looked inside myself, \\nthat was exactly what I wanted to do. \\n\\nSitting down with Tad Smith, a publishing executive and one \\nof my best friends  and  advisors,  I was  told  I had to  get  over the \\nprestige of working for a Fortune 500 company. If I wanted to be \\nCEO, I had to find a company I could grow with. \\n\\nIt  was  exactly  the  advice  I  needed  to  hear.  I  had  been  too \\nfocused  on  big  companies.  While  the  dot-com  crash  had  made \\nentering the digital world a whole lot less palatable, there were still \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cWhat's Your Mission? \", \"37 \\n\\nsome  very  good  companies  in  need  of  business  fundamentals. \\nNow I knew this was where I needed to look, and I began refining \\nmy action plan. \\n\\nFrom that day on, many of the calls I made, and the meetings \\nand conferences I attended, were aimed at finding the right small \\ncompany to call home. Three months later, I had five job offers. \\n\\nOne of the people I reached out to was Sandy Climan, a well-\\nknown  Hollywood  player  who  once  served  as  Michael  Ovitz's \\nright-hand man  at  Creative Artists Agency and who  then  ran  an \\nL.A.-based venture-capital firm called Entertainment Media Ven \\ntures. I had gotten to know Sandy during my time with Deloitte, \\nwhen I was exploring paths  into the entertainment world. Sandy \\nintroduced me to the people at a company called YaYa, one of the \\ninvestments in his firm's portfolio. \\n\\nYaYa  was  a  marketing  company  pioneering  the  creation  of \\nonline games as advertising vehicles. They had a good concept and \\nthe strength of committed employees and founders. They needed \\na bigger vision to  get the market's  attention, some buzz for their \", 'sell, sell, sell. \\n\\nIn November 2000, when the YaYa board offered me the CEO \\nposition, I knew it was the right fit. The company was located in \\nLos Angeles, and  it offered the  sort of unconventional  route  into \\nthe  entertainment world  I  had been  looking for  and  a  chance to \\nbring my experience as a marketer to the CEO job. \\n\\nIf Virginia  Can  Do  It,  You  Can  Too \\n\\nA few  months  ago,  a  friend  of mine  told  me  about a  woman  named \\n\\nVirginia  Feigles,  who  lived  not too  far  away from  where  I  grew  up. \\n\\nHe  had  been  inspired  by her tale of triumph.  Hearing  her story,  I  felt \\n\\nthe  same  way. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c38 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nAt forty-four,  Feigles  decided  she  no  longer wanted  to  be  a  hair \\n\\ndresser;  she wanted  to  be  an  engineer.  From  the  get-go,  there were ', 'naysayers,  people who  insisted  it couldn\\'t  be  done.  Their  negativity \\n\\nsimply  provided  more  fuel  for  her  fire. \\n\\n\"I  lost a  lot of friends during  this whole thing,\"  Feigles says.  \"Peo \\n\\nple  become  jealous  when  you  decide  to  do  what  no  one  thought \\n\\nyou  would,  or could.  You  just  have  to  push  through.\" \\n\\nHer  adventure  reads  like  a  Cliffs  Notes  guide  to  career  manage \\n\\nment  where  a  bold  mission  and  a  commitment  to  reach  out  to  oth \\n\\ners  combine  to  create  opportunities  previously  unavailable  to  a \\n\\nhigh  school  graduate.  It  also  conveys  a  harsh  dose  of  reality: \\n\\nChange  is  hard.  You  might  lose  friends,  encounter  seemingly  insur \\n\\nmountable  obstacles,  and  face  the  most  troubling  hurdle  of  all— \\n\\nyour  own  self-doubt. ', 'Feigles  had  always  planned  to  go  to college.  Raised  by a  single \\n\\nmother  in  small-town  Milton,  Pennsylvania,  the  opportunities  were \\n\\nslim.  She was  married  by seventeen  and  pregnant a year  later.  She \\n\\nworked  full  time  as  a  hairstylist  in  her  husband\\'s  salon  and  raised \\n\\nher  only  son.  Twenty  years  went  by.  With  her  second  divorce, \\n\\nFeigles  rethought  her  life.  Growth,  she  reflected,  came  only  from \\n\\nchange.  And  change  came  only  from  new  goals. \\n\\nShe was working  part-time  as  a  secretary at the chamber of com \\n\\nmerce when  she  realized  life  had  more  to offer.  \"I  just thought,  \\'This \\n\\nis  stupid.

The \\n\\nassociate  dean,  Trudy  Cunningham,  didn\\'t  sugarcoat  the  situation. \\n\\n\"When  she  arrived,  I  told  her  that  life  was  about  to  get  hard. \\n\\nShe\\'s  an  adult with  a  life,  an  apartment,  a  car,  and  she  was  com \\n\\npeting  with  kids  who  were  living  in  dorms  and  having  their  meals \\n\\ncooked.\" \\n\\nLuckily,  Feigles  had  always  been  an  avid  connector  all  her  life. \\n\\nShe  was  a  member  of  a  number  of community  organizations,  serv-\\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cWhat\\'s Your Mission?

She also had  stints serving  as \\n\\npresident  of  the  Garden  Club  and  the  Milton  Business  Association. \\n\\nShe  had  supportive  friends  and  advisors  all  around. \\n\\nFor  the  other  students,  the  end  of  class  meant  keg  parties  and \\n\\nfootball  games.  For  her,  it  meant  a  night  working  at  the  salon  fol \\n\\nlowed  by  grinding  study  sessions.  Feigles  doesn\\'t  remember  a  day \\n\\nshe  didn\\'t  think  of  quitting. \\n\\nShe  remembers  getting  back  her  first  physics  test.

Clinton  promptly  pulled  out  a  black  address  book. \\n\\n\"What  are  you  doing  here  at  Oxford, Jeff?\"  he  asked. \\n\\n\"I\\'m  at  Pembroke  on  a  Fulbright,\"  Jeff  replied.  Clinton  penned \\n\\n\"Pembroke\"  into  his  book,  then  asked  about  Stamps\\'s  undergradu ', 'ate  school  and  his  major.  \"Bill,  why  are  you  writing  this  down?\" \\n\\nasked  Stamps. \\n\\n\"I\\'m  going  into  politics  and  plan  to  run  for  governor  of Arkansas, \\n\\nand  I\\'m  keeping  track  of everyone  I  meet,\"  said  Clinton. \\n\\nThat  story,  recounted  by  Stamps,  epitomizes  Bill  Clinton\\'s  forth \\n\\nright approach  to  reaching  out  and  including  others  in  his  mission. \\n\\nHe  knew,  even  then,  that  he wanted  to  run  for office,  and  his  sense \\n\\nof  purpose  emboldened  his  efforts  with  both  passion  and  sincerity. \\n\\nIn  fact,  as an  undergraduate at Georgetown,  the  forty-second  pres \\n\\nident  made  it  a  nightly  habit  to  record,  on  index  cards,  the  names \\n\\nand  vital  information  of  every  person  whom  he\\'d  met  that  day. \\n\\nThroughout his career,  Clinton\\'s  political  aspirations and  his  abil ', \"ity  to  reach  out  to  others  have  gone  hand-in-hand.  In  1984,  when \\n\\nhe  was  governor  of  Arkansas,  he  attended,  for  the  first  time,  a \\n\\nnational  networking  and  thought  leadership  event  called  Renais \\n\\nsance  Weekend  in  Hilton  Head,  South  Carolina.  Clinton  secured \\n\\nan  invitation  through  his  friend,  Richard  Riley,  who was  then  gover \\n\\nnor  of South  Carolina.  Attending  Renaissance  Weekend  was  like  a \\n\\ntrip  to  a  toy  store  for  a  guy  like  Clinton,  who  wasted  no  time  meet \\n\\ning  others  and  making  friends.  Here's  how  a  Washington  Post arti \\n\\ncle  from  December  1992  describes  Clinton  in  action  at  the  event: \\n\\nMany  guests,  reflecting  on  Clinton's  presence,  remember \\n\\nimages  more  than  words:  how  he  would  roam  from  discus \", 'sion  to  discussion  and  take  a  spot  at  the  side  of  the  room, \\n\\nleaning  casually  against  the  wall;  how  he  would  seem  to \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cWhat\\'s Your Mission? \\n\\n41 \\n\\nknow  everyone,  not  just  from  their  name  tags,  but  remember \\n\\nwhat  they  did  and  what  they  were  interested  in.  \"He  hugs \\n\\nyou,\"  said  Max  Heller,  the  former  mayor  of  Greenville.  \"He \\n\\nhugs  you  not  only  physically,  but with  a  whole  attitude.\" \\n\\nWhat  Heller  is  referring  to  is  Clinton\\'s  unique  ability to create  an \\n\\nalmost  instantaneous  intimacy  with  whomever  he\\'s  talking  to.  Clin \\n\\nton  doesn\\'t  just  recall  your  personal  information;  he  uses  the  infor \\n\\nmation  as  a  means  to  affirm  a  bond  with  you. \\n\\nFrom  Clinton,  two  lessons  are  clear:  First,  the  more  specific  you ', 'are  about  where  you  want  to  go  in  life,  the  easier  it  becomes  to \\n\\ndevelop  a  networking  strategy  to  get  there. \\n\\nSecond,  be  sensitive  to  making  a  real  connection  in  your  inter \\n\\nactions  with  others.  There  is  almost  an  expectation  among  us  that \\n\\nwhoever  becomes  rich  or  powerful  can  be  forgiven  for  high-handed \\n\\nbehavior.  Clinton  illustrates  how  charming  and  popular  you  can \\n\\nbecome,  and  remain,  when  you  treat  everyone  you  meet  with \\n\\nsincerity. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cC H A P T ER \\n\\n4 \\n\\nBuild It Before You Need It \\n\\nBuild a little community of those you love and who love you. \\n\\n— M I T CH  ALBOM \\n\\nForget  the  images  we  all  have  in  our  heads  of the  desperate, \\n\\nout-of-work  individuals  scooping  up  every business  card  in \\nsight  while  fervently mingling  at  business  conventions  and job-', 'reaching out to  others only when you need something like a job. \\nIn reality, people who have the largest circle of contacts, mentors, \\nand friends know that you  must reach  out to  others  long  before \\nyou need anything at all. \\n\\nGeorge,  for  example,  is  a  smart  guy  in  his  twenties  who \\nwas introduced to me through a mutual friend.

Once he could answer those questions, the next step was to \\ngo hang with this new circle of people. \\n\\n\"The  most  important  thing  is  to  get  to  know  these  people \\nas friends, not potential customers,\" I said. \"Though you\\'re right \\nabout  one  thing:  No  matter  how friendly you  are,  if the  people \\nyou approach  are  any good at what they do, they won\\'t hire you \\nright  off the  bat  to  do  their  PR.  Which  is  why you  should  offer \\nyour  services  for  free—at  least  at  first.  For  instance,  maybe  you ', 'involved  in,  or  aid  in  publicizing  a  school  fundraiser  their  kids \\nare involved in.\" \\n\\n\"But won\\'t my employer be  angry at my expending  so  much \\n\\nenergy on other things?\" George asked. \\n\\n\"Doing good work for your employer comes first,\" I told him. \\n\"Finding time to manage your outside work is your responsibility. \\nConcentrate  on  an  industry that  your  present  employer  doesn\\'t \\nservice.

He \\nwanted more for me, his  son. He and I were inseparable when I \", \"me everywhere with him). He knew I would have a better life if he \\ncould help me find a way out of our working-class heritage. \\n\\nBut my dad didn't know the exits. He'd never been to college. \\nHe knew nothing  of country clubs  or  private  schools.  He  could \\npicture only one man who would have the sort of pull that could \\nhelp me: his boss. Actually, the boss of his boss's boss's boss—Alex \\nMcKenna, CEO of Kennametal, in whose factory my dad worked. \\nThe two men had never met. But Dad had a clear sense of how \\nthe world worked. He'd observed, even from the plant floor, that \\naudacity was  often  the  only thing that  separated two  equally tal \\nented  men  and  their  job  titles.  So  he  asked  to  speak  with \\nMcKenna. McKenna, upon hearing the request, was so intrigued \\nthat he took the meeting. In the course of the meeting, he agreed \\nto meet me—but nothing more. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cThe Genius of Audacity \\n\\n49 \\n\\nIt  turned  out  that  McKenna  liked me—partly because  of the \", \"private elementary school, the Valley School of Ligonier, where all \\nthe wealthy families sent their children; by reputation  it was  one \\nof the best elementary schools in the country. Strings were pulled, \\nand Mr.  McKenna got us  an appointment with  Peter Messer, the \\nheadmaster. \\n\\nThe day I enrolled in the Valley School, on scholarship, I entered \\na new world that set me on an entirely new course, just as my father \\nhad hoped. Over the next ten years, I got one of the best educations \\nin  America,  starting  with  Valley  School,  then  Kiski  School, Yale \\nUniversity, and on to Harvard Business School. And it would never \\nhave happened if my father hadn't believed that it never hurts to ask. \\nAs I look back on my career, it was the single most important \\nact  in  my  life.  Moreover,  the  lesson  I  learned  from  my  father's \\naction, like no other, informed all that I have done since. \\n\\nMy father simply couldn't be embarrassed when it came to ful \\nfilling  his family's needs. I remember once we were driving down \", 'cycle  in  someone\\'s  trash.  He  stopped  the  car,  picked  it  up,  and \\nknocked  on  the  door  of  the  home  where  the  discarded  toy  lay \\nwaiting to be picked up. \\n\\n\"I spotted this Big Wheel in your trash,\" he told the owner. \"Do \\nyou mind if I take it?  I  think I  can fix it.  It would make me feel \\nwonderful to give my son something like this.\" \\n\\nWhat guts!  Can you imagine such a proud, working-class guy \\napproaching that woman  and, essentially, admitting he\\'s  so  poor \\nthat he\\'d like to have her garbage? \\n\\nOh, but that\\'s not the half of it. Imagine how that woman felt, \\nhaving  been  given  an  opportunity to  give  such  a gift  to  another \\nperson. It surely made her day. \\n\\n\"Of  course,\" she  gushed,  explaining  that  her  children  were \\ngrown  and  that  years  had  passed  since  the  toy  had  been  used. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c50 ', 'Never Eat Alone \\n\\n\"You\\'re welcome to the bicycle I have, too. It\\'s nice enough that I \\njust couldn\\'t throw it away...\" \\n\\nSo we drove on. I had a \"new\" Big Wheel to ride and a bike to \\ngrow into. She had a smile and a fluttering heart that only benev \\nolence breeds. And Dad had taught me that there is genius, even \\nkindness, in being bold. \\n\\nEvery time I start to set limits to what I can and can\\'t do, or fear \\nstarts to  creep  into my thinking, I  remember that Big Wheel tri \\ncycle.  I  remind  myself how people with  a low tolerance  for risk, \\nwhose behavior is guided by fear, have a low propensity for success. \\nThe  memories  of those  days  have  stuck  with  me.  My father \\ntaught me that the worst anyone can say is no. If they choose not \\nto give their time or their help, it\\'s their loss. \\n\\nNothing in  my life has  created opportunity like  a willingness \\nto  ask,  whatever  the  situation.  When  I  was  just  an  anonymous \\nattendee at the Davos Economic Forum  in Switzerland, I walked ', \"like a rock star to me, given his  extraordinary success  at creating \\nand building Nike, and the many marketing innovations he intro \\nduced over the years. Was I nervous? You bet. But I jumped at the \\nopportunity to  speak with  him,  and made  a  beeline  for the  seat \\nnext  to  his.  Later,  he  would  become  YaYa's  first  blue-chip  cus \\ntomer. I do this sort of thing all the time, whatever the situation. \\n\\nSometimes  I  fail.  I've  got  an  equally long  list  of people  I've \\nattempted  to  befriend  who  weren't  interested  in  my  overtures. \\nAudacity in networking has the same pitfalls and fears associated \\nwith dating—which I'm not nearly as good at as I am the business \\nvariety of meeting people. \\n\\nSticking to the people we already know is a tempting behavior. \\nBut  unlike  some  forms  of  dating,  a  networker  isn't  looking  to \\nachieve only a single successful union. Creating an enriching cir \\ncle of trusted relationships requires one to be out there, in the mix, \", \"myself to people I don't know, the fear that they might reject me is \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cThe Genius of Audacity \\n\\n51 \\n\\nthere. Then I remember the Big Wheel my father got me, and push \\nahead anyway. \\n\\nMost  of us  don't  find  networking  the  least  bit  instinctive  or \\nnatural.  Of  course,  there  are  individuals  whose  inherent  self-\\nconfidence and social skills enable them to connect with ease. \\n\\nThen there are the rest of us. \\nIn the early days at YaYa, I was worried for the company's sur \\nvival. For the first time in my career, I had to reach out to a lot of \\npeople  I  didn't know, representing  an  unknown company, push \\ning a product that was untested in the marketplace. It was uncom \\nfortable.  I  didn't  want  to  cold-call  executives  from  BMW  and \\nMasterCard and pitch them my wares. But you know what? Push \\ning  to  get  into  BMW was  not  that  difficult when  the  alternative \\nwas  laying  off  a  bunch  of  my  staff  or  failing  in  the  eyes  of my \", '\\nMustering the audacity to talk with people who don\\'t know me \\noften  simply comes  down to  balancing the fear I  have  of embar \\nrassment against the fear of failure and its  repercussions.  For my \\nfather,  either he  asked or his family didn\\'t have.  For me,  I  either \\nask  or  I\\'m  not  successful.  That  fear  always  overrides  my anxiety \\nabout rejection or being embarrassed. \\n\\nUltimately,  everyone has to  ask himself or herself how they\\'re \\ngoing to fail. We all do, you know, so let\\'s get that out of the way. \\nThe choice isn\\'t between success and failure; it\\'s between choosing \\nrisk and striving for  greatness,  or risking nothing  and being  cer \\ntain of mediocrity. \\n\\nFor many people, the fear of meeting others  is  closely tied to \\nthe fear of public speaking (a fear that consistently beats out death \\nas the one thing we dread most). Some of the world\\'s most famous \\nspeakers  admit  to  feeling  similar  anxiety.  As  Mark  Twain  said, \\n\"There are two types of speakers: those that are nervous and those ', \"\\nThe best way to  deal with this  anxiety is to first acknowledge \\nthat  our fear  is  perfectly normal. You  are  not  alone.  The  second \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c52 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nthing  is to  recognize that getting over that fear is  critical to your \\nsuccess. The third is to commit to getting better. \\n\\nHere are a few things you can do today to make good on that \\ncommitment  and  get  more  comfortable  at  being  audacious  in \\nsocial situations: \\n\\n•  Find a role model. \\n\\nWe're predisposed to seek out people like us—shy people tend to \\ncongregate  with  other  shy people,  and  outgoing  people  congre \\ngate  with  outgoing  people—because  they  unconsciously  affirm \\nour own  behaviors.  But everyone knows  that  one  person within \\ntheir group  of friends  and associates who  seems to  engage others \\nwith little or no fear. If you're not yet ready to take the big leap of \\naddressing new people on your own, let these people help you and \\nshow  you  the  way.  Take  them  with  you,  when  appropriate,  to \", \"actions. Over time, you'll adopt some of their techniques. Slowly, \\nyou'll build up the courage to reach out by yourself. \\n\\n•  Learn to speak. \\n\\nMany  businesses  have  responded  to  the  nearly  infinite  number \\nof people  who  recognize  they  need  to  become  better  speakers. \\nThese educational organizations realize you're not looking to give \\nspeeches  to  an  audience  of a thousand people  (at least initially). \\nMost  people  who  come  to  them  for  help  are  looking  to  gain \\nself-confidence  and  some  trusty  tools  for  overcoming  shyness. \\nThey don't offer one or two simple quick-fix cure-alls. What they \\ndo  offer  is  a  chance  to  practice,  in  a  nonintimidating  environ \\nment, with an instructor who can guide and push you. There are \\nhundreds of coaches and schools devoted to this type of training. \\nOne  of the  most  well  known  is  the  Toastmasters  Club.  They're \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cThe Genius of Audacity \", '53 \\n\\nsure to have a local chapter in your area. It is a well-run organiza \\ntion that has helped millions  of people hone their speaking skills \\nand overcome their fears. \\n\\n•  Get  involved. \\n\\nYou\\'ll  feel  most  comfortable  when  you\\'re  doing  something  you \\nenjoy with  others  who  share  your  enthusiasm.  Any hobby is  an \\nopportunity  to  get  involved:  stamp  collecting,  singing,  sports, \\nliterature.  Clubs  develop  around  all  of these  interests.  Join  up. \\nBecome an active member. When you feel up to it, become one of \\nthe leaders of the group. This last step is crucial. Being a leader in \\nlife takes  practice—so  practice!  The possibilities for making new \\ncontacts and reaching out to others will grow and grow. \\n\\n•  Get therapy. \\n\\nI know, I know, you\\'re probably thinking, \"He wants me to go to \\ntherapy to  become  better  at  talking  to  people?\"  Let me  explain. \\nOne, I think merely acting on the desire to be better than you are \\nnow, no matter the venue, is a very important commitment. Two, ', 'pist at one point in their lives or another. I\\'m not suggesting ther \\napy will make you a better people  person, but it might help you \\naddress your own fears and social anxieties in a more productive \\nway.  Many  studies  funded  by  the  National  Institute  of  Mental \\nHealth report a high success rate using counseling to alleviate the \\nconditions that normally inhibit a shy person. \\n\\n•  Just do  it. \\n\\nSet a goal for yourself of initiating a meeting with one new person \\na week. It doesn\\'t matter where or with whom. Introduce yourself \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c54 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nto  someone on the bus.  Slide up next to  someone at the bar and \\nsay hello. Hang out at the company water cooler and force your \\nself to talk to  a fellow employee you\\'ve never spoken with. You\\'ll \\nfind that it gets easier and easier with practice. Best of all, you\\'ll get \\ncomfortable with the idea of rejection. With that perspective, even \\nfailure  becomes  a  step  forward.  Embrace  it  as  learning.  As  the \\nplaywright Samuel Beckett wrote, \"Fail, fail again. Fail better.\" ', 'Fear debilitates. Once you realize there\\'s no benefit to holding \\nback, every situation and every person—no matter how seemingly \\nbeyond your reach—becomes an opportunity to succeed. \\n\\nThe  Madam  of  Moxie \\n\\nWhen  it  comes  to  improving  your  speaking  skills,  no  one  is  better \\n\\nthan  DeAnne  Rosenberg,  a  thirty-two-year  career  counselor  and \\n\\nowner  of  her  own  management consulting  firm,  DeAnne  Rosenberg \\n\\nInc.  Rosenberg  is  the  madam  of  moxie,  and  for  good  reason. \\n\\nIn  1969,  she  read  a  Wall  Street  Journal  article  that  noted \\n\\nthe  absence  of  a  female  voice  in  the  American  Management \\n\\nAssociation. \\n\\n\"They  were  interviewing  the  then  president  of  the  A.M.A.,  who \\n\\nwas  quoted  as saying,  \\'We  haven\\'t found  a woman who can  speak \\n\\nauthoritatively  in  public  about  management,\\'\"  Rosenberg  recalls. \\n\\nShe cut the article out and sent a  letter to the A.M.A.  telling them to ', 'look  no  further.  Two weeks went  by and  her  letter went  unanswered. \\n\\n\"Well,  that wouldn\\'t do,\" she snaps.  \"I wrote another  letter straight \\n\\nto  the  president,  effectively telling  them  to  put  up  or  shut  up.\" \\n\\nTwo  days  later,  the  president of the  association  called  to  say that \\n\\nthey  had  scheduled  her  for  a  lecture.  DeAnne  went  on  to  become \\n\\nthe  first woman  to  speak  on  behalf  of  the  A.M.A. \\n\\nThe  lesson  from  that fateful  series  of events  remains with  her:  The \\n\\nrecipe  for achievement is  a  medley of self-assuredness,  dogged  per \\n\\nsistence,  and  audacity.  Encounters  of  the  audacious  kind,  as \\n\\nDeAnne  learned,  are what successful  careers  are  built  upon.  In  her \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cThe Genius of Audacity \\n\\n55 \\n\\nmany  years  teaching  others  to  overcome  their  fears,  she\\'s  created ', 'a  time-tested  script that anyone  can  use when  meeting  someone  for \\n\\nthe  first  time. \\n\\nI  found  the  script  helpful.  I  think  it can  help  a  lot  of you  as well, \\n\\nand  I  gratefully  offer  it  to  you  here: \\n\\n1. State  the  situation.  \"You  go  right  in  and  hit  them  with  how  you \\n\\nsee  it  in  the  cold  light  of  day,  without  being  too  inflammatory \\n\\nor  dramatic,\"  says  Rosenberg.  She  made  it  clear  to  the  A.M.A. \\n\\nthat a)  having  no women  speakers was wrong,  and  b)  hiring  her \\n\\nwould  be  a  step  in  the  right direction.  It  makes  sense  that  before \\n\\nyou  can  speak  persuasively—that  is,  before  you  speak  from  a \\n\\nposition  of passion  and  personal  knowledge—you  need  to  know \\n\\nwhere  you  stand. \\n\\n2.  Communicate  your  feelings.  We  downplay  the  influence  of  emo ', 'tions  in  our day-to-day contacts,  especially in  the  business world. \\n\\nWe\\'re  told  that  vulnerability  is  a  bad  thing  and  we  should  be \\n\\nwary  of  revealing  our  feelings.  But  as  we  gain  comfort  using  \"I \\n\\nfeel\"  with  others,  our  encounters  take  on  depth  and  sincerity. \\n\\nYour  emotions  are  a  gift  of  respect  and  caring  to  your  listeners. \\n\\n3.  Deliver  the  bottom  line.  This  is  the  moment  of  truth  when  you \\n\\nstate,  with  utter clarity,  what  it  is you  want.  If you\\'re  going  to  put \\n\\nyour  neck  on  the  line,  you\\'d  better  know  why.  The  truth  is  the \\n\\nfastest  route  to  a  solution,  but  be  realistic.  While  I  knew  Phil \\n\\nKnight  of  Nike  wasn\\'t  going  to  buy  anything  based  on  one  five-', \"minute conversation on a  bus at Davos,  I did  make sure to get his \\n\\ne-mail  and  tell  him  that  I'd  like  to  follow  up with  him  again  some \\n\\ntime. Then  I  did  so. \\n\\n4.  Use an open-ended question. A request that is expressed as a ques \\n\\ntion—one  that cannot  be  answered  by  a  yes  or  no—is  less  threat \\n\\nening.  How  do  you  feel  about  this?  How  can  we  solve  this \\n\\nproblem?  Can  we  meet  up  again  sometime  soon?  The  issue  has \\n\\nbeen raised, your feelings expressed, your desires articulated. With \\n\\nan  open-ended  suggestion  or  question,  you  invite  the  other  person \\n\\nto work toward a solution with you.  I didn't insist on a specific lunch \\n\\ndate  at  a  specific  time with  Phil.  I  left  it  open  and  didn't  allow  our \\n\\nfirst exchange  to  be weighted  down  by  unnecessary obligations. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cC H A P T ER \", '6 \\n\\nThe Networking Jerk \\n\\nAmbition can creep as well as soar. \\n\\n— E D M U ND  BURKE \\n\\nHe  is  the  man  or  she  is  the  woman  with  a  martini  in  one \\n\\nhand, business cards in the other, and a prerehearsed eleva \\n\\ntor pitch always at the ready. He or she is a schmooze artist, eyes \\ndarting at every event in a constant search for a bigger fish to fry. \\nHe  or  she  is  the  insincere,  ruthlessly ambitious  glad-hander you \\ndon\\'t want to become. \\n\\nThe networking jerk is the image that many people have when \\nthey hear  the  word \"networking.\"  But  in  my book,  this  breed  of \\nhyper-Rolodex-builder and card-counter fails to grasp the nuances \\nof authentic  connecting.  Their  shtick  doesn\\'t  work  because  they \\ndon\\'t know the first thing about creating meaningful relationships. \\n\\nAs I learned the hard way. \\nIf you knew me as a younger man, you may not have liked me. \\nI\\'m not sure I liked myself that much. I made all the classic mis ', 'wore my unquenchable ambition on my sleeve, befriending those \\nabove  me  and  ignoring  my peers.  Too  often  people  put  on  one \\nface with their subordinates, another with their boss, and another \\none yet with their friends. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cThe Networking Jerk \\n\\n57 \\n\\nWhen  I  became  responsible for marketing  at Deloitte,  I  sud \\ndenly had  a  lot  of people  reporting  to  me.  I  had  some  very big \\nideas  about  what  I  wanted  to  do—things  that  never  had  been \\ndone  from  a  marketing  standpoint  in  the  world  of  consulting. \\nAnd  now finally I  had  a  team  with  which  to  execute  them.  But \\ninstead  of  viewing  my  employees  as  partners  to  be  wooed  in \\nachieving my long-term objectives and theirs, I saw them as called \\nupon to carry out my tasks. \\n\\nAdd to this my young age (I was twenty years younger than any ', 'other  member  of the  executive  committee),  and you  can  under \\nstand  why  the  resistance  among  my  staff was  holding  all  of  us \\nback.  Tasks  that  I  thought  should  have  taken  hours  ended  up \\ntaking days. I knew I needed to do something, so I reached out to \\nan executive coach, Nancy Badore, who had been coaching high-\\nlevel CEOs before there was a name for such a thing. \\n\\nThe day of our first meeting, sitting in my office, we barely had \\na chance to exchange pleasantries before I blurted out, \"What do I \\nneed to do to become a great leader?\" \\n\\nShe looked around my office for a few moments and said noth \\ning. When she finally spoke, it struck me to the core. \"Keith, look \\nat all the pictures on your wall. You talk about aspiring to become \\na great leader, and there\\'s not one picture in your whole office of \\nanybody but you:  you with  other  famous  people, you  in  famous \\nplaces,  you  winning  awards.  There\\'s  not  one  picture  in  here  of ', 'accomplished that would lead anybody like me to know that you \\ncare for them as much as you care for yourself. Do you understand \\nthat it\\'s your team\\'s accomplishments, and what they do because \\nof you, not for you, that will generate your mark as a leader?\" \\n\\nI was floored by her question. She was absolutely right. Had I \\nshown the genuine concern I had for the lives my employees led \\noutside of work? Why hadn\\'t I made an effort to make them part \\nof the leadership? I\\'d been doing it with my bosses from day one. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c58 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nI realized then my long-term success depended on everyone around \\nme. That I worked for them as much as they worked for me! \\n\\nPoliticians  understand this  in  a way too few executives  grasp: \\nWe vote for the people we like and respect. Great companies are \\nbuilt by CEOs who inspire love and admiration. In today\\'s world, \\nmean guys finish last. \\n\\nMy friend and author Tim Sanders taught me there are two rea \\nsons for the end of the era of mean business. First, we live in a new \\n\"abundance of choice in business\" in everything from products to ', 'ers. \"At a time when more of us have more options than ever, there\\'s \\nno need to put up with a product or service that doesn\\'t deliver, a \\ncompany that we don\\'t like, or a boss whom we don\\'t respect,\" he \\nwrites. The second reason is what he calls the \"new telegraph.\" \"It\\'s \\nalmost impossible for a shoddy product, a noxious company, or a \\ncrummy person to keep its, his, or her sad reality a secret anymore. \\nThere are too many highly opinionated and well-informed people \\nwith access to e-mail, instant messaging, and the Web.\" \\n\\nThe bottom line is if you don\\'t like someone, it\\'s easier than ever \\nto escape him. When you don\\'t have others\\' interests at heart, people \\nwill find out sooner rather than later. Our culture demands more of \\nus these days. It demands that we treat each other with respect. That \\nevery relationship be seen in mutually beneficial terms. \\n\\nWhen you look back upon a life and career of reaching out to \\nothers, you want to see a web of friendships to fall back on, not the \\nashes  of bad encounters. Here are a few rules  I  can  suggest from ', 'ing Jerk: \\n\\n1.  Don\\'t schmooze. \\n\\nHave  something  to  say,  and  say it with  passion.  Make  sure you \\nhave something to offer when you speak, and offer it with sincer \\nity. Most people haven\\'t figured out that it\\'s better to spend more \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cThe Networking Jerk \\n\\n59 \\n\\ntime with fewer people at a one-hour get-together, and have one \\nor  two  meaningful  dialogues,  than  engage  in  the  wandering-eye \\nroutine and lose the respect of most of the people you meet. I get \\ne-mails  all  the  time  that read, \"Dear Keith,  I  hear you\\'re  a  good \\nnetworker. I am, too. Let\\'s sit down for fifteen minutes and a cup \\nof coffee.\" Why?  I ask myself. Why in the world do people expect \\nme  to  respond  to  a  request  like  that?  Have  they appealed to  me \\nemotionally?  Have  they  said  they  could  help  me?  Have  they \\nsought some  snippet of commonality between  us?  I\\'m  sorry, but ', 'practiced for its own virtue. We must bring virtue to it. \\n\\n2. Don\\'t rely on the currency of gossip. \\n\\nOf course, using  gossip  is  easier.  Most people lap  up  such  infor \\nmation. But it won\\'t do you any good in the long run. Eventually \\nthe information well will run dry as more and more people realize \\nyou\\'re not to be trusted. \\n\\n3. Don\\'t  come  to  the party  empty-handed. \\n\\nWho are the stars of today\\'s Internet world? Bloggers. Those free \\nwheeling cybernauts who set up sites and online journals to pro \\nvide  information,  links,  or  just  empathy  to  a  community  of \\nlike-minded  individuals.  They  do  it  for  free,  and  they\\'re  often \\nrewarded with  a devout following of people who, in return, offer \\nas much as they receive. It\\'s a loop. In connecting, as in blogging, \\nyou\\'re only as good as what you give away. \\n\\n4. Don\\'t  treat  those  under you poorly. \\n\\nSoon enough, some of them will become \"overlings.\" In business, ', 'and down the ladder. Michael Ovitz, the famed Hollywood super-\\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c60 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nagent, was said to be a master networker. A scathing and relatively \\nrecent Vanity Fair profile, with dozens of anonymous and not-so-\\nanonymous  sources  taking  shots  at  the  man,  was  a  very  public \\nexpression  of a  dazzling  career that had  gone  somehow horribly \\nwrong.  People  asked  what  happened?  Ovitz  has  some  amazing \\ninterpersonal  skills, but he wielded them  disingenuously.  People \\nhe  no  longer  needed  he  treated  with  indifference,  or  worse.  It \\nwasn\\'t  surprising that these  same  people not only reveled  in, but \\nmay have also contributed to, his fall. \\n\\n5. Be  transparent. \\n\\n\"I am what I am,\" the cartoon character Popeye used to say. In the \\ninformation age, openness—whether it concerns your intentions, \\nthe  information  you  provide,  or  even  your  admiration—has \\nbecome  a  valuable  and  much-sought-after  attribute.  People ', 'them. At a conference, when I run into someone I\\'ve been dying to \\nmeet, I don\\'t hide my enthusiasm. \"It\\'s a pleasure to finally meet \\nyou.  I\\'ve  admired your work from  afar  for  quite  some  time  and \\nbeen  thinking  how  beneficial  it  might  be  if we  could  meet  one \\nanother.\" Coy games may work in a bar, but not when you\\'re look \\ning to establish a deeper, more meaningful connection. \\n\\n6. Don\\'t be  too  efficient. \\n\\nNothing  comes  off as  less  sincere  than  receiving  a  mass  e-mail \\naddressed to a long list of recipients. Reaching out to others is not \\na numbers game. Your goal is to make genuine connections with \\npeople you can count on. \\n\\nI\\'m embarrassed by the way I learned this lesson. I had always \\nheard  that  sending  out  holiday/New Year\\'s  greeting  cards  was  a \\ngood idea. So I began a practice when I graduated from Yale to send \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cThe Networking Jerk \\n\\n61 \\n\\na holiday card to everyone in my contact database. By the time I was ', 'temp help to address and even sign the cards at year\\'s end. Well, we \\nall can see this coming. The intention was good enough until a col \\nlege  roommate noted  (actually gibed)  how appreciative he was to \\nget not  one but actually three  cards  one year  . ..  all with  different \\nsignatures. It\\'s not about mass, it\\'s about a real connection. \\n\\nIf you\\'re  not  making  friends  while  connecting,  best  to  resign \\nyourself to  dealing with  people who  don\\'t care much  about what \\nhappens  to  you.  Being  disliked  will  kill  your  connecting  efforts \\nbefore  they  begin.  Alternatively,  being  liked  can  be  the  most \\npotent, constructive force for getting business done. \\n\\nCONNECTORS\\'  HALL  OF  FAME  PROFILE \\n\\nKatharine  Graham  (1917-2001) \\n\\n\"Cultivate  trust in  everyone.\" \\n\\nTragedy  transformed  Katharine  Graham  from  wife  to  publisher \\n\\novernight.  She  took  over  the  Washington  Post  in  1 963  after  the ', \"death  of her  husband,  Philip  Graham.  Her  shy and  quiet  demeanor \\n\\nseemed  unfit  to  deal  with  the  demands  of one  of the  most  important \\n\\nnewspapers  in  the  country.  Graham  proved  everyone  wrong.  She \\n\\nhelped  to  build  one  of  the  great  newspapers  and  most  successful \\n\\nbusinesses  in  America.  During  her  era,  the  Post published  the  Pen \\n\\ntagon  Papers,  took  President  Nixon  head-on  over  Watergate,  and \\n\\nruled  Washington's  political  and  media  scene  in  a  style  that  was \\n\\ninimitably  her  own. \\n\\nIn  fact,  it was  this  style  that  is  her  most  lasting  legacy.  Running \\n\\nthe  Post with compassion,  kindness,  and  sincerity,  Graham  became \\n\\na  powerful  figure.  Graham's  influence  gave  her  an  ability  to \\n\\nempower  others—from  the  highest  echelons  of  society  to  its  low \", \"est—with  a  sense  of  dignity  and  respect. \\n\\nRichard  Cohen,  a  columnist  for  the  Washington  Post,  wrote  the \\n\\nfollowing  a  few  days  after  Graham's  funeral: \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c62 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nOn  a  beastly  July  Sunday  some  years  ago,  I  returned  to \\n\\nWashington  from  the  beach  and  took  a  taxi  to  the  parking \\n\\ngarage  across  the  street  from  the  Washington  Post  where  I \\n\\nkept  my car.  A  tent  had  been  erected  on  the  Post's  own  park \\n\\ning  lot.  It  was  for  a  company  party,  given  for  people  whose \\n\\nnames  you  never  hear—those  un-bylined,  non-TV-appearing \\n\\ntypes  who  take  the  ads  or  deliver  the  paper  or  maybe  just \\n\\nclean  the  building.  In  the  heat,  I  saw Katharine Graham  plod \", \"ding  toward  the  party. \\n\\nShe was  old  by then,  and  walking  was  difficult for  her.  She \\n\\npushed  her way  up  the  ramp,  moving  in  a  laborious  fashion. \\n\\nShe had  a  farm  in Virginia,  a  house  in  Georgetown,  an apart \\n\\nment  in  New  York  and,  most  significantly  that  hideously  hot \\n\\nday,  a  place  on  the  water  in  Martha's  Vineyard.  Yet  here  she \\n\\nwas—incredibly,  I  thought—doing  the  sort  of thing  vice  presi-\\n\\ndents-for-smiling  do  in  other  companies. \\n\\nAnalyze  the  life  of  Katharine  Graham,  and  one  inescapable \\n\\ntheme  emerges:  Despite  a  lifetime  free  from  financial  worry,  and \\n\\na  social  status  bordering  on  royalty,  she  made \\n\\nfriends  with \\n\\neveryone—not  just  those  who  could  assist  her  newspaper  or  aug \", \"ment  her  position  within  the  Beltway. \\n\\nMost  reports  on  her  funeral  mentioned  celebrity  names  like \\n\\nHenry  Kissinger,  Bill  Clinton,  Bill  Gates,  Warren  Buffett,  and  Tom \\n\\nBrokaw.  But you  don't  have  to  do  much  heavy lifting  before you  find \\n\\nan  extensive  list  of  non-celebrity attendees.  Here's  a  sampling: \\n\\n• \\n\\nIrvin  Kalugdan,  a  Fairfax  County  special-education  teacher who \\n\\nfounded  a  student  break-dancing  team  with  a  $ 3 50  Washington \\n\\nPost grant \\n\\n•  Rosalind  Styles,  from  the  Frederick  Douglass  Early  Childhood  and \\n\\nFamily Support Center,  for which  Graham  had  helped  raise  money \\n\\n•  Henrietta  Barbier  of  Bethesda,  a  woman  retired  from  the  Foreign \\n\\nService,  belonged  to  a  weekly  bridge  club  of about sixty women \\n\\nat  the  Chevy  Chase  Women's  Club.  She  said  Graham  never \", 'missed  a  session:  \"She was  bright about the  game,  and  she took \\n\\nlessons,  and  she  was  serious.\" \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cThe Networking Jerk \\n\\n63 \\n\\nAll  of which  reveals  an  inner  truth  about  the  skill  of  reaching  out \\n\\nto  others:  Those  who  are  best  at  it  don\\'t  network—they  make \\n\\nfriends.  They  gain  admirers  and  win  trust  precisely  because  their \\n\\namicable  overtures  extend  to  everyone.  A  widening  circle  of  influ \\n\\nence  is  an  unintended  result,  not  a  calculated  aim. \\n\\nGraham\\'s  relationship  with  former  Secretary  of  State  Henry \\n\\nKissinger,  more  than  anyone,  highlighted  her  flare  for  friendship \\n\\nqua  friendship,  as  opposed  to  friendship  for  ulterior  purposes. \\n\\nOn  the  surface,  the  two  seemed  the  unlikeliest  of  pals:  After  all, ', \"the  crucial  moments  of  Graham's  career  were  stunning  blows  to \\n\\nKissinger's.  First,  in  1 9 7 1,  there was  Graham's  decision  to  publish \\n\\nthe  Pentagon  Papers,  confidential  documents  detailing  the  U.S. \\n\\ninvolvement  in  the  Vietnam  War.  A year  later  the  Post,  at Graham's \\n\\nbehest,  began  its  Watergate  investigations.  Both  led  to  the  embar \\n\\nrassment  of  the  Nixon  administration  in  which  Kissinger  served. \\n\\nYet  there  was  Kissinger,  the  first  speaker  to  eulogize  Graham  at \\n\\nher  funeral.  He  and  Graham  frequently  attended  movies  together. \\n\\nHow did  Graham  form  such  an  alliance,  such  a  friendship?  How \\n\\ndid  she  create  connections  with  everyone  from  anonymous  teach \\n\\ners  to  the  world's  most  famous  and  powerful?  By  knowing  her \", 'boundaries  and  cultivating  trust  in  others;  by  being  discreet;  by the \\n\\nsincerity  of  her  intentions;  by  letting  the  other  person  know  she  had \\n\\nhis  or  her  best  interests  at  heart. \\n\\nIn  an  interview with  C N N,  Kissinger  remarked:  \"It was a  strange \\n\\nrelationship  in  the  sense  that  her  paper  was  on  the  opposite  side \\n\\nfrom  my views very often,  but she  never attempted  to  use  our friend \\n\\nship  for  any  benefit for  her  newspaper.  She  never  asked  me  for spe \\n\\ncial  interviews  or  anything  of  that  kind.\" \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cSECTION  TWO \\n\\nThe Skill Set \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cC H A P T ER \\n\\n7 \\n\\nDo Your Homework \\n\\nSpectacular  achievement  is  always  preceded  by  spectacular ', \"\\n— R O B E RT  H.  SCHULLER \\n\\nWhom you meet, how you meet them, and what they think \\n\\nof you afterward should not be left to chance. As Winston \\nChurchill would tell us, preparation is—if not the key to genius— \\nthen at least the key to sounding like a genius. \\n\\nBefore I meet with any new people I've been thinking of intro \\nducing myself to, I research who they are and what their business \\nis. I find out what's important to them: their hobbies, challenges, \\ngoals—inside their business and out. Before the meeting, I gener \\nally prepare, or have my assistant prepare, a one-page synopsis on \\nthe person I'm about to meet. The only criterion for what should \\nbe included  is  that  I want to  know what this  person  is  like  as  a \\nhuman being, what he or she feels strongly about, and what his or \\nher proudest achievements are. \\n\\nSure,  you  should  also  be  up-to-date  on  what's  happening \\nwithin the company of a person you want to establish a relation \\nship  with.  Did  the  person  have  a  good  or bad  quarter?  Do  they \", 'above and beyond anything else, about what it is  they do. If you \\nare informed enough to step comfortably into their world and talk \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c68 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nknowledgeably,  their  appreciation  will  be  tangible.  As  William \\nJames wrote: \"The deepest principle in human nature is the crav \\ning to be appreciated.\" \\n\\nThese days, doing such research is easy. Here are a few places to \\nstart: \\n\\n•  The Internet. Be sure to check out the company\\'s Web site. Use \\nsearch  engines,  like  Google,  to  check  a  person\\'s  affiliations. \\nGoing to a meeting without Googling someone is unacceptable. \\n\\n•  The public library, where you\\'ll find books, periodicals, maga \\nzines, trade journals, etc. Check for articles written by or about \\nthe people you intend to meet. If there aren\\'t any, read up  on \\nthe person\\'s industry or type of job. Most of this can be found \\nonline, too. \\n\\n•  Literature  from  the  company\\'s  public  relations  department. \\nCall and explain that you have a scheduled meeting and would ', \"\\n•  Annual reports. They'll give you a good idea of where a com \\npany  is  headed  and  what  challenges  and  opportunities  lie \\nahead. \\n\\nSetting out to know someone inevitably means understanding \\nwhat their problems or needs are. At work, it may be their product \\nline. But as you talk with the person, you'll also find out that per \\nhaps their kids are hoping to land an internship, that they them \\nselves have health issues, or they just want to  cut strokes  off their \\ngolf game. The point is, you have to reach beyond the abstract and \\nget to  someone  as  an  individual.  Find  a way to  become  part  of \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cDo Your Homework \\n\\n69 \\n\\nthose things that are of most interest to them, and you will have \\nfound a way to become part of their life. \\n\\nRecently,  I  took part  in  a  roundtable  discussion  sponsored by \\nthe Milken Institute's Global Conference in Los Angeles, an annual \\nthree-day gathering  that  brings  together  the  world's  top  thinkers \\nand CEOs to work over global problems. There were fifteen partic \", \"In  many  settings,  I  probably  wouldn't  have  been  rubbing \\nelbows with them, but because I had helped organize the confer \\nence (always an advantage), I was invited to participate. \\n\\nThe events were planned with a CEO's tight schedule in mind. \\nThere was a brief mixer before the event to allow the participants \\nto mingle and get to know one another. Then a panel discussion \\non the future of marketing, given the challenges facing big brands. \\nAfterward, a short dinner. \\n\\nIn  other  words,  there  was  about  a  three-hour  window  of \\nopportunity where I could hope to establish a foundation for one \\nor two relationships. \\n\\nA successful conference's agenda is always created to maximize \\nthe participants' time. My own goal at such conferences is to max \\nimize  the  brief windows  of  opportunity  I  might  get  to  become \\nintimate with other interesting people I haven't met before. \\n\\nFood,  I  find,  has  a  unique  ability to  facilitate  conversation. \\nPeople  are  usually open,  even  eager, to  be  amused while  eating. \\nMeals  at conventions, however, are problematic. They're rushed, \", \"You're  never  sure  where  you'll  end  up  sitting.  And  among \\nstrangers,  it's  usually difficult  to  focus  beyond  the  people  sitting \\neither to your left or right. \\n\\nAnd during the panel, people are focused on their own presen \\n\\ntations. \\n\\nThat left the mixer. During mixers, I like to hang out near the \\nbar. Virtually everyone gets a drink at some point. Throughout the \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c70 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nday,  I  had also  scouted  out which  rooms  the  people  I wanted to \\nmeet were holding court in for the day, and arranged my schedule \\nso I could be there as they were walking in or out. It sounds a bit \\nmanipulative, but really, it's just putting yourself in the right posi \\ntion at the right time. \\n\\nThe challenge in such circumstances, as it is in every conversa \\ntion, is to try to transcend the trivialities of polite chitchat. I had \\ngotten to know the lead organizer of the event during the preced \\ning  months,  and  based  on  casual  conversation  I  generally knew \", \"preparation. My office compiled simple bios of the VIPs who were \\ncoming in case I ended up meeting them or sitting next to them. \\nMy assistant prepared a few one-pagers on the one or two individ \\nuals I especially wanted to meet. \\n\\nThis is all part of what I call just doing your homework. That \\nalone, however, is not enough. The idea is to find a point of com \\nmon ground that is deeper and richer than what can be discovered \\nin a serendipitous encounter. Armed with knowledge about a per \\nson's passions, needs, or interests, you can do more than connect; \\nyou'll have an opportunity to bond and impress. \\n\\nA master politician like Winston Churchill planned his public \\nencounters in the same way. Churchill today is known as an ora \\ntory  genius,  master  of the  art  of repartee—the  kind  of fantastic \\ndinner guest who  captures  everyone's  undivided attention. What \\nis  less  known—but  which  Churchill  acknowledged  in  his  own \\nwriting—is  the  blood,  sweat,  and  tears  of preparation  that went \\ninto  the  making  of a  single  sentence  or  the  delivery  of a  clever \", \"knowing how to push their buttons. \\n\\nSo how did I do? \\nI discovered that one of the CEOs, John Pepper, was also a fel \\nlow graduate of Yale. I had admired him since I was an undergrad \\nand had seen him  speak on campus.  The former CEO  of Procter \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cDo Your Homework \\n\\n71 \\n\\n&  Gamble,  Pepper was  committed to  human  rights  and making \\nsure  the  story  of the  Underground  Railroad was  preserved  in  a \\nmuseum  devoted  to  the  subject  he  was  founding  in  Cincinnati. \\nPepper was known for his leadership and the innovations in mar \\nketing he had brought to Procter & Gamble. Even now, after step \\nping  down,  he  continued  to  be  a  powerful  influence  on  P&G's \\nboard and on the boards of several other companies. \\n\\nKnowing  he  had  attended Yale,  I  knew  that he'd  have  a  bio \\nlisted on the Yale University Web site. So I tapped into my alumni \\nnetwork for more information. There, I found a treasure trove of \", \"been in Berkley College at Yale. That meant he must have known \\nRobin  Winks,  a  warmly  admired  and  much-respected  professor \\nfor whom I had worked while in college. When I brought up our \\nmany common experiences, we hit it off. \\n\\nBy the end of our conversation, John was giving me insightful \\nadvice  about  and  contacts  for  my young  company  (YaYa  at  the \\ntime). He invited me to keep in touch in the coming years. I hoped \\nour paths would cross many more times over the years, and they \\ncertainly have. When Professor Winks—Robin—passed away just \\na week later, we shared our memories of him. A few months later, \\nI  met  a  successful  businessman  from  Cincinnati  who  was  brag \\nging  about  the  museum  enshrining  the  Underground  Railroad \\nand I made a point of putting him in touch with John Pepper for \\nfundraising.  I've  probably  introduced  two  or  three  potential \\ndonors to John in the last year. \\n\\nI  had  no  affiliations  or  organizations  in  common  with  the \", 'revealed that she had run the New York City Marathon the previ \\nous year. I know firsthand how much commitment and sacrifice it \\ntakes to train day in and day out to run and complete a marathon. \\nI had tried—and failed.  I had begun to train for a marathon  one \\nyear, but my knees started to act up, to my disappointment. By the \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c72 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nway, I\\'m always looking for good advice on how I might someday \\nbe able to run a marathon. \\n\\nWhen I ran into this CEO, I said, \"You know, I don\\'t know how \\nyou do it. I like to think I\\'m in great shape, but the training for a \\nmarathon killed me. I had to stop.\" \\n\\nOf course, she was  surprised. \"How the heck did you know I \\n\\nran a marathon?\" she happily quipped. \\n\\nI  never  shy away from  mentioning  the  research  I\\'ve  done. \"I \\nalways make a special effort to inquire about the people I\\'d like to \\nmeet.\" Inevitably, people are flattered. Wouldn\\'t you be? Instantly, \\nthe  other  person  knows  that  rather  than  suffering  through  a ', 'someone  with  whom  they  share  an  interest,  someone  who  has \\ngone out of his way to get to know them better. \\n\\nAs  it  happened,  the  day  before  I  had  gone  through  \"Barry\\'s \\nBoot  Camp,\"  a  tough-as-nails  but  totally  exhilarating  exercise \\nregimen  in West Hollywood,  not far from  the  conference.  I  said, \\n\"If you  want  an  amazing  and  different  workout  sometime,  you \\nshould consider boot camp.\" In return, I received some welcome \\nadvice  for  extending  my running  regimen.  Later,  she  tried  boot \\ncamp with me and loved it. \\n\\nTo  this  day,  each  time  she  and I  meet, we  talk  about  Barry\\'s \\nBoot Camp and I give her my progress report on my goal of run \\nning a marathon. And what I have found with those I\\'ve converted \\nto my boot camp workout is that when they visit L.A., they might \\nnot  have  time  to  take  a  meeting  or  lunch  with  others,  but  they ', \"core workout together. \\n\\nOnce  again, your  goal  in  such  a setting  is  to  transform  what \\ncould  be  a  forgettable  encounter  into  a  blossoming  friendship. \\nThere  are  shortcuts  in  my  system,  but  this  isn't  one  of them.  I \\nwouldn't  have  been  able  to  reach  out  to  these  individuals,  and \\ntruly connect, without doing my homework. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cC H A P T ER \\n\\n8 \\n\\nTake Names \\n\\nOnce you've taken the time to figure out what your mission is \\n\\nand where you want to get to, the next step is to identify the \\n\\npeople who can help you get there. \\n\\nThe  successful  organization  and  management  of the  informa \\ntion that makes connecting flourish is vital. Tracking the people you \\nknow, the people you want to know, and doing all the homework \\nthat will  help  you  develop  intimate  relationships with  others  can \\ncause one heck of an information overload. How do you manage it? \\nLuckily, today we have a whole new set of software  and hardware \", \"\\nBut  you  don't  need  the  latest  and  greatest  gadgets.  Ink  and \\npaper are a perfectly suitable way to keep track of the new people \\nin your expanding social life. I'm a list-taking madman, and you \\nshould become one, too. \\n\\nMy  experience  at  YaYa  is  a  good  example  of how  lists  help \\npeople  achieve their  goals.  On  my last  day at  Starwood,  I  made \\nmore than forty phone calls. One of them was to  Sandy Climan. \\nWhat's interesting about the call, and the dozens of others like it I \\nmade that  day, is  that long before  any of these  people knew me, \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c74 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nmany of them had been on one of many lists I'd been keeping for \\nyears. \\n\\nIt  was  Sandy who  eventually  recruited  me  to  YaYa.  It  didn't \\nhurt that one of the other investors with a stake in the company, \\nKnowledge Universe, was  backed by the famed financier Michael \\nMilken, who  ultimately became  a mentor of mine whom I'd met \", '\\nIn  November  2000,  the  YaYa  board  named  me  CEO  and \\nhanded me two goals: establish a viable business model, and either \\nfind  a major investor or sell the company to a well-heeled strate \\ngic acquirer. At the time, YaYa had the technology to invent online \\ngames  that  corporations  could  use  to  attract  and  educate  their \\ncustomers, but the company had no customers—or revenue. \\n\\nFirst,  I  sat  down  and  established  a ninety-day,  one-year,  and \\nthree-year  mission  in  my  Networking  Action  Plan.  Each  goal \\nrequired  me  to  connect  with  and  develop  different  parts  of my \\nnetwork. \\n\\nIn  ninety  days,  I  had  to  establish  credibility with  the  board, \\ngain  the  trust  of my employees,  and  set  a  clear  direction  for  the \\nbusiness. \\n\\nIn  a year,  I wanted to  have  enough  blue-chip  accounts  to be \\nclose  to  profitability  and  moving  toward  making  the  company ', 'prove  to  the  outside  world  that YaYa  was  producing  something \\nworthwhile.  The  concept  of  advergaming,  which  wasn\\'t  even  a \\nword then, was not considered a viable segment of the advertising \\nmarket. Interactive ads were hopelessly ineffective, and banner ads \\non Web sites were now considered an industry joke. We had to dif \\nferentiate ourselves. \\n\\nI wanted a business model in place three years down the road \\nthat  could  function  without  me,  gain  liquidity for  my investors, \\nand  solidify  the  company\\'s  standing  as  a  thought  leader  in  the \\nonline marketing arena. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cTake Names \\n\\n75 \\n\\nTo make these goals possible, I mapped out the most impor \\ntant players  in both the online and games industries, from CEOs \\nand journalists  to  programmers  and  academics.  My goal  was  to \\nget to know almost all of them within a year. \\n\\nTo create excitement around our product, I wrote down a list \\nof  people  I  called  \"influentials\":  the  early  adopters,  journalists, ', \"product  or  service.  Next,  I  made  a  list  of  potential  customers, \\npotential  acquirers, and people who might be interested in fund \\ning  us  down  the  road.  (In  creating  your  own  categories,  each \\nshould correspond to your own goals.) \\n\\nWhen you make such lists, it's important you name the actual \\ndecision makers, and not just an organization. The point here is to \\nhave a readily accessible and specific list of names. \\n\\nAt the outset, concentrate on the people who  are already part \\nof your  existing  network.  I  bet  you  have  no  idea  how vast  and \\nwidespread it really is. As I noted in the previous chapter, take the \\ntime to list people such as: \\n\\nRelatives \\n\\nFriends of relatives \\n\\nAll your spouse's relatives and contacts \\n\\nCurrent colleagues \\n\\nMembers of professional and social  organizations \\n\\nCurrent and former customers and clients \\n\\nParents of your children's friends \\n\\nNeighbors, past and present \\n\\nPeople you went to school with \\n\\nPeople you have worked with in the past \\n\\nPeople in your religious congregation \\n\\nFormer teachers and employers \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c76 \", \"Never Eat Alone \\n\\nPeople you socialize with \\n\\nPeople who provide services to you \\n\\nNext, I enter the gathered names into a database. (I tend to use \\nMicrosoft's  Outlook, but  there  are  plenty of programs  out  there \\nthat are just as good.) I then create call sheets by region, listing the \\npeople  I  know and  those  I'd  like  to  know. When  I'm  in  a  given \\ntown, I'll try to phone as many people as I can. I have the numbers \\nin my Palm and BlackBerry; both devices have unique and impor \\ntant functionality to me, so I've kept both. \\n\\nI also print out and carry these lists around with me wherever \\nI go. They focus my efforts in cabs between meetings. I have some \\nthing palpable to encourage me to reach out. Some of the lists you \\ncreate will be related to your action plans; others are more general, \\nhelping you to stay connected. The way you organize your lists can \\nbe fluid. I have lists by geographical location, by industry, by activ \\nity (other runners, for instance,  or  people who like to  go  out on \", 'Adding to the names on your lists is simply a matter of looking \\nin  the right  place.  In the beginning  stages  at YaYa, I  read all the \\ntrade magazines having to do with advertising and games. If I read \\nabout someone who fell into one of my categories, I\\'d put him on \\na list and find out his contact information. \\n\\nWhen  you\\'re  looking  for  people  to  reach  out  to,  you\\'ll  find \\nthem  everywhere.  One  great  resource  for  making  lists  is—it \\nalmost  sounds  absurd—other  people\\'s  lists.  Newspapers  and \\nmagazines do rankings of this sort all the time. \\n\\nLong before I became one of CrairCs \"40 Under 40,\" for exam \\nple, I had been ripping out that list for years. I clip out lists of top \\nCEOs,  most  admired  marketers,  the  nation\\'s  most  progressive \\nentrepreneurs—all  of these  kinds  of lists  are  published  in  local \\nand national publications; every industry has something similar. \\nYou want not only to know who  the  players  in your field are ', 'www.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cTake Names \\n\\n77 \\n\\nbut eventually to be recognized as one of those players. The peo \\nple who are on Crain\\'s \"40 Under 40\" aren\\'t necessarily the forty \\nbest businesspeople.  They are, however,  probably the forty most \\nconnected. And they probably all have lunched with one another \\nat one time or another. When you get to know these people, and \\nthe people they know (including the journalists at Crain\\'s respon \\nsible for the \"40 Under 40\"), you\\'re that much more likely to be on \\nthe list yourself the next time it appears. \\n\\nThere\\'s  another category you might want to  add, something I \\ncall  my \"aspirational  contacts.\"  There  are  those  extremely  high-\\nlevel people who have nothing to do with my business at hand but \\nare just, well, interesting or successful or both. The people on that \\nlist maybe anyone from heads of state and media moguls, to artists \\nand actors, to people others speak highly of. I list these people, too. \\nIf you could see my Palm, I could show you the contact infor \\nmation for Richard Branson, chairman of the Virgin empire. Now, ', \"down  a  bit  farther,  you'll  find  Howard  Stringer,  CEO  of  Sony \\nCorp.  of America.  He  was  on  my  aspirational  list  once.  I  now \\nknow Howard. \\n\\nPeople  get  a  chuckle  out  of  this,  but  the  results  speak  for \\n\\nthemselves. \\n\\nRemember, if you're  organized, focused, and  a stickler for taking \\nnames, there's no one that's out of reach. \\n\\nAs  for me,  my three years  at YaYa  came  to  a  close.  In  2002, \\nForbes magazine reported on our extraordinary rise to success as a \\nstart-up that had come from nowhere with a totally new concept. \\nThe  concept  of  advergaming  gained  a  cultural  currency  in  the \\nmarketplace,  and the term is  now used by CEOs  and journalists \\nalike.  The  other  day  I  overheard  a  CEO,  who  didn't  know  we \\nhad  created the word,  bragging  about  the  innovative  tool  called \", 'www.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c78 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\n\"advergaming\" that had led to  a measurable  increase  in the sales \\nand recognition of his  product. As  planned, YaYa was  ultimately \\nsold to a public company, giving investors access to the liquid cur \\nrency they were looking for and giving YaYa the operating capital \\nit needed. And it\\'s clear that without that bunch of lists to thank, \\nYaYa would never have made it beyond the first year of operations. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cC H A P T ER \\n\\n9 \\n\\nWarming the Cold Call \\n\\nCold  calls  turn  even  the  most  competent  of souls  into  neu \\n\\nrotic  messes.  I  can  relate  to  those  who  go  catatonic  at  the \\n\\nvery idea of calling a stranger. \\n\\nSo how do you manage a cold call? \\nFirst,  it\\'s  all  about  attitude. Your  attitude. You\\'re  never  going \\nto  be  completely  ready  to  meet  new  people;  there  is  no  perfect \\nmoment.  Your  fears  will  never  be  completely  quieted,  because ', 'hundred reasons to procrastinate. The trick is to just plunge right \\nin. Remember, if you don\\'t believe you are going to  get what you \\nwant from the call, you probably won\\'t. So, in the words of Caddy \\nShack, \"Be the ball.\" You have to envision yourself winning to win. \\nYou have to view getting to know new people  as  a  challenge \\nand an opportunity. The very idea should spark your competitive \\nfires,  silencing  the  wallflower  in  all  of  us  that  shies  away  from \\nsocially adventuresome behavior. \\n\\nAnd second, cold calls are for suckers. I don\\'t call cold—ever. \\nI\\'ve created strategies that ensure every call I make is a warm \\n\\none. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c80 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nLet me give you an example. Jeff Arnold, founder of WebMD, \\nis a friend. He had recently bought out the rights and patents for a \\ntechnology that puts digital content on a miniature DVD disk for \\na  unique  delivery.

With  20  billion  or  so \\nfountain beverages  sold each year, this  is  a compelling new form \\nto get digital content into American hands. \\n\\nIn  talking  with  Jeff and  his  partner,  Thomas  lull,  I  was  told \\nabout the deal they had just closed with a movie theater company \\nto  distribute  their  DVDs  on  beverages  sold  at  theaters.  Jeff and \\nThomas  thought  that,  given  the  demographics  of moviegoers,  a \\ncompany  like  Sony  Electronics  could  stand  to  benefit  from  this \\nnew distribution technology. But they didn't know whom to con \\ntact at Sony and came to me for thoughts. \\n\\nI  had  met  Sir  Howard  Stringer,  CEO  of  Sony,  a  number  of \\ntimes, so I put a call into his office. But instead of just waiting for \\nHoward to  get back to  me, I wanted to find a few other paths as \\nwell. At the time, I couldn't think of anyone else within my net \", 'maker within Sony. When no one responded to my phone calls or \\ne-mails, I  researched which  agencies  serviced  Sony,  and  I  found \\nthat  Brand  Buzz,  a  marketing  agency  within  advertising  giant \\nYoung & Rubicam, counted Sony as one of its top clients. \\n\\nFurthermore, the person who was  CEO  of Brand Buzz at the \\n\\ntime, John Partilla, is a close friend of mine. \\n\\nSo I called him. \"Hey, John, I\\'ve got two things for you. One, \\nI  want  you  to  meet  a  buddy  of  mine  named  Jeff Arnold.  He\\'s \\nbrilliant  and  creative  and  you  should  know  him.  He\\'s  the  guy \\nwho  founded WebMD  and  he\\'s  started  a  new company,  Convex \\nGroup,  which  may need  your  services  down  the  line.  And  two, \\nConvex is  putting out this  incredible technology that distributes \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cWarming the Cold Call \\n\\n81 \\n\\ndigital content in a new way. I think Sony would appreciate being ', \"\\nIn a sense, by reaching out in this way, I was offering John two \\nopportunities:  a  chance  to  know  someone  of  importance  and \\ninterest,  perhaps  for new business, through  Jeff,  and  a  chance  to \\nlook good with the business he  already had—Sony—by bringing \\nthem new opportunities. \\n\\nJohn was happy to make the connection. He knew the perfect \\nguy, the new head of Media  & Internet Strategies  at  Sony, Serge \\nDel Grosso. I asked John to send a brief introductory e-mail ahead \\nof my call and CC me in the process. By having him copy me on \\nthe  e-mail,  in  all  subsequent  correspondence  to  Serge,  I  could \\ninclude John, and put some urgency behind our meeting. Tacitly, \\nas a result, both John and I were now waiting for a meeting with \\nSerge. \\n\\nAs  with  so  many business  dealings,  that  alone  didn't  do  the \\ndeed.  Serge was  busy, and I  heard nothing back from him  or his \\nadministrative  assistant  after  several  e-mails.  This  isn't  unusual. \", \"aside  and  persist  in  calling  or writing. And when you  do  finally \\nconnect,  don't  sabotage your  efforts  by expressing  how annoyed \\nyou are that they didn't get back to you  as  quickly as you would \\nhave  liked.  Nor  should  you  apologize  for  your  persistence.  Just \\ndive in as if you caught him on the first call. Make it comfortable \\nfor everyone. \\n\\nSetting up such meetings takes time. It is up to you to take the \\ninitiative. Sometimes, you have to be aggressive. After a few weeks \\nof no  reply, I  called  Sony information  and  eventually got  Serge's \\ndirect line. When I call someone directly whom I haven't spoken \\nwith before, I try to call at an unusual time. Someone who is busy \\nis more likely to pick up their own phone at 8:00 A.M. or 6:30 P.M. \\nPlus,  they're  probably  less  stressed  out  since  they're  not  facing \\ntypical nine-to-five pressures. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c82 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nI  called  in  the  early morning,  but  got  Serge's  voice  mail.  So \", 'our  meeting.  I\\'ve  never  heard  John  talk  so  flatteringly  of  a \\nbusiness associate. I understand how busy you must be. I haven\\'t \\nheard  from  your  administrative  assistant,  but  I\\'m  sure  I  will. \\nSee  you  soon.\"  At  no  point  do  you  want  your  interactions  to \\nbecome strained.  Creating  and maintaining  a sense of optimism \\nand  gentle  pressure  around  the  appointment  is  all  part  of  the \\ndance. \\n\\nWhen  I  still  didn\\'t hear from his  office, I  called Serge\\'s  direct \\nline  after  hours,  around  6  P.M.  This  time,  Serge  picked  up  the \\nphone himself and I gave him the pitch. \\n\\n\"Hi, Serge.  It\\'s  Keith  Ferrazzi. John\\'s talked highly of you for \\nsome  time,  and  I\\'ve finally got  a nice  excuse  to  give  you  a  call. \\nI\\'m calling for my friend Jeff Arnold, the founder of WebMD, who ', 'some of the new products you\\'ll be launching this quarter, it could \\nmake  for the  perfect  partnership.  I\\'ll  be  in  New York next week. \\nLet\\'s get together. Or, if getting together this trip isn\\'t convenient, \\nI\\'ll make room in my schedule for whenever it\\'s more convenient \\nfor you.\" \\n\\nIn fifteen seconds,  I  used my four  rules  for what  I  call  warm \\ncalling:  1)  Convey  credibility  by  mentioning  a  familiar  person \\nor institution—in this case, John, Jeff, and WebMD. 2)  State your \\nvalue  proposition:  Jeff\\'s  new  product  would  help  Serge  sell  his \\nnew products.  3)  Impart urgency and convenience by being pre \\npared to do whatever it takes whenever it takes to meet the other \\nperson on his or her own terms. 4) Be prepared to offer a compro \\nmise that secures a definite follow-up at a minimum. \\n\\nThe result? I was in Serge\\'s office the next week. And, while his \\n\\nbudgets  didn\\'t  allow  a  short-term  application,  he  totally  under ', \"prised if sometime  soon your movie-theater beverage has  a cool \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cWarming the Cold Call \\n\\n83 \\n\\nlittle DVD  on the lid brimming over with some of Sony's newest \\ntechnology. \\n\\nHere are some of the rules I follow fleshed out in more detail: \\n\\n1. Draft off a reference. \\n\\nThe reason a cold call feels like torture was set out in vivid detail \\nfifty  or  so  years  ago  in  an  advertisement,  recalled  by  Harvey \\nMacka, in his book Swim with the Sharks. It pictures a corporate \\nkilljoy facing the  reader, who  is  cast  in the  role  of the  salesman. \\nThe killjoy says: \\n\\nI don't know who you are. \\n\\nI don't know your company. \\n\\nI don't know what your company stands for. \\n\\nI don't know your company's customers. \\n\\nI don't know you company's products. \\n\\nI don't know your company's reputation. \\n\\nNow—what was it you wanted to sell me? \\n\\nYou  can  see  the  total  lack  of credibility one  has  when  making  a \", \"interaction,  and ultimately, no  one will buy from you unless you \\nestablish trust. Having a mutual friend or even acquaintance will \\nimmediately make you stand out from the other anonymous indi \\nviduals vying for a piece of someone's time. \\n\\nWhat  do  I  mean  by that?  If you  are  calling  on  behalf of the \\npresident, I guarantee you Mr. Killjoy on the other end of the line \\nwill  listen  to  what  you  have  to  say.  Drafting  off  the  brands  of \\nothers, whether personal  references  or organizations, is  a helpful \\ntactic to get past someone's initial reluctance. \\n\\nMost  of  us,  however,  don't  work  for  Microsoft  or  know  the \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c84 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\npresident  of the  organization  we're  trying  to  reach  out  to.  Our \\ntask, then, is to tap our network of friends, family, clients, neigh \\nbors,  classmates,  associates,  and church  members  to  find  a  path \", \"someone both of you have in common, all of a sudden the person \\nyou're  calling  has  an  obligation  not  only to  you  but  also  to  the \\nfriend or associate you just mentioned. \\n\\nToday,  finding  a line into someone's office is a lot easier than \\n\\nwhen I started out. \\n\\nAgain,  the wonderfully effective  search  engine  Google.com  is \\nnearly  invaluable  in  this  process.  Do  a  name  search  and  you'll \\nlikely find where a person went to school, what his or her interests \\nare, and what boards he or she sits on—you'll get a perspective on \\nthe person's life that should give you ideas on where a mutual con \\ntact might be found. What  sports  do  they play? What nonprofits \\ndo they care about? Do you know other people involved in similar \\ncauses? \\n\\nA whole host of new companies, like Spoke and Linkedln, spe \\ncialize in helping you find connections to people you want to get \\nin  touch  with.  A  company  called  Capital  IQ  aggregates  market \\ndata and information  on executives, for example, to make it very \", \"nies, like Friendster, Ryze, and ZeroDegrees, help to broker con \\nnections inside and outside of companies around the world. Some \\nof these networks are better for finding a date, so you'll have to see \\nfor yourself which one makes more sense for you. \\n\\nPeople  used  to  say there  were  only six  degrees  of separation \\nbetween anyone in the world. Today, we're only one or two mouse \\nclicks away. \\n\\n2.  State your value. \\n\\nAcquiring a reference or institution to  draft off of is  only a start \\ning point. It will help you get your foot in the door. Once you have \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cWarming the Cold Call \\n\\n85 \\n\\nsomeone's commitment to hear you out for thirty seconds, you'll \\nneed  to  be  prepared  to  deliver  a  high-value  proposition. You've \\ngot very little time to articulate why that person should not try to \\nget off the phone as quickly as possible. Remember, it's all about \\nthem. What can you do for them? \\n\\nWhen  researching for a connection to the people you want to \\nmeet, first do some reconnaissance about the company and indus \", 'another  person\\'s  problems. And you  can  only do  that when you \\nknow what those problems are. When I finally got a chance to talk \\nwith  Serge,  for  instance,  I  already  knew  he  was  preparing  to \\nlaunch  some  new products  in  the  upcoming  quarter,  and  in  the \\nbusy holiday season he was  going to  need  something that would \\nreally stand out. I also knew his target audience aligned well with \\nthose going to the theaters. \\n\\nI can cut through the clutter of other cold calls by personaliz \\ning  my  call  with  specific  information  that  shows  I\\'m  interested \\nenough in their success to have done some homework. \\n\\n3.  Talk a little, say a lot. Make it quick, convenient, \\nand  definitive. \\n\\nYou want to impart both a sense of urgency and a sense of conve \\nnience. Instead of closing with \"We should get together some time \\nsoon,\" I like to finalize with something like \"I\\'m going to be in town \\nnext week. How about lunch on Tuesday? I know this is going to be \\nimportant for both of us, so I\\'ll make time no matter what.\" ', 'You will, of course, need to provide enough information about \\nyour value  proposition  to  make  the  person  want  to  spend  some \\ntime talking.  But also, don\\'t talk too much.  If you launch into  a \\nlong sales  pitch without finding out the other person\\'s thoughts, \\nyou can turn them off immediately. It is a dialogue, not a scripted \\nmonologue. Even my  fifteen-second  intro  above left time for the \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c86 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\ncasual \"ah huh, yes\" or \"hmm\" from the other person. Don\\'t ever \\ntalk at someone. Give them time to come along with you. \\n\\nRemember,  in  most  instances,  the  sole  objective  of the  cold \\ncall is, ultimately, to get an appointment where you can discuss the \\nproposition in more detail, not to close the sale. In my experience, \\ndeals,  like  friendships,  are  made  only  one-to-one,  face-to-face. \\nTake as little time as possible in your cold call to ensure that the \\nnext time you speak to them it\\'s in their office, or better yet, over ', \"\\n4.  Offer a compromise. \\n\\nIn any informal negotiation, you go big at the outset, leaving room \\nfor compromise and the ability to ratchet down for an easier close. \\nI closed my pitch to Serge by suggesting that even if he didn't want \\nto  hear  anything  about  digital  content,  I'd  love  to  get  together \\nwith him just to meet, given  our mutual friend's  admiration  and \\nrespect. \\n\\nRobert B. Cialdini's book The Psychology of Persuasion shows \\nhow  compromise  is  a  powerful  force  in  human  relations.  An \\nexample used to illustrate this idea concerns Boy Scouts, who are \\noften turned down initially when trying to sell raffle tickets. It has \\nbeen statistically shown, however, that when the Scout then offers \\ncandy bars instead, a less costly item, customers will buy the candy \\neven  if they  don't  really want  it.  In  giving  in  to  the  concession, \\npeople feel as if they're holding up their social obligation to oth \\ners. So remember, try for a lot—it will help you settle for what it is \\nyou really need. \", 'www.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cC H A P T ER  1  0 \\n\\nManaging the Gatekeeper \\nArtfully \\n\\nLet\\'s face it, having a list of names of people you want to reach \\n\\nin business, and a plan for what to  say to them when you\\'ve \\ngot them on the phone, doesn\\'t mean much if you never get them \\non the phone. Half the difficulty in reaching out to others is actu \\nally reaching  somebody at  all.  It\\'s  even  more  difficult when  that \\nsomebody is a Big Kahuna with a thicket of protective voice mail \\nboxes,  blind  e-mail  addresses,  and  defensive  assistants  running \\ninterference. \\n\\nSo how do you open the door? \\nFirst,  make  the  gatekeeper  an  ally  rather  than  an  adversary. \\nAnd never, ever get on his or her bad side. Many executive assis \\ntants  are  their  bosses\\'  minority  partners.  Don\\'t  think  of  them \\nas \"secretaries\" or as \"assistants.\" In  fact, they are  associates  and \\nlifelines. ', 'Every  time  I  have  ever  tried  to  go  head-to-head  with  an \\nadministrative  assistant,  I\\'ve  lost.  It\\'s  like  that  childhood  game: \\nrock, paper, scissors. Well, in this game, as Mary Abdo taught me, \\nthe \"associate\" trumps all. \\n\\nMary was  the  assistant  to  Pat  Loconto,  the  CEO  of Deloitte \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c88 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\n(and I guess still is, even though Pat is retired), and in the begin \\nning, we got along great. I remember once finishing up  a dinner \\nwith Pat and Mary. Mary had to leave early, so I walked her out \\nside while she got a taxi. The next day, I  called to  say thanks for \\narranging such a wonderful evening. \\n\\nApparently, people rarely called Mary to thank her for organ \\nizing events, and she was very grateful. She even bragged the next \\nmorning to Pat about how much she liked me. \\n\\nMary was a blast: fun and full of energy and wonderful stories. \\nIn my early days  at Deloitte, when I\\'d call Pat, I\\'d spend an extra ', 'back,  my  relationship  with  Mary  was  clearly  one  of  the  most \\nimportant  reasons  I  was  given  such  easy access  to  Pat. And  my \\nrelationship with Pat was one of the most important relationships \\nof my business life. \\n\\nHowever,  with  Mary  and  me  there  was  a  time  when  all  that \\n\\nbegan to change. I had just become chief marketing officer. \\n\\nAt that time, I got my very own full-time administrative assis \\ntant, who  I\\'ll  call  Jennifer.  I  thought  Jennifer was  everything  I\\'d \\nwant in an assistant: smart, organized, efficient. We got along great. \\nThe only problem was she didn\\'t get along with Mary—at all. \\n\\nMary managed  all  the  administrative  assistants  in  our  execu \\ntive  suite.  Almost  immediately,  Jennifer  and  Mary were  butting \\nheads. Jennifer was digging in her heels and not letting up. I just \\nthought they\\'d work it out eventually. \\n\\n\"It\\'s  all  a  power  play.  She\\'s  wasting  my time,\" Jennifer  com ', 'plained. \\n\\nI wanted to be supportive. Jennifer\\'s complaints and concerns \\nseemed reasonable to me, but I was hearing only one side  of the \\nstory.  I  encouraged  Jennifer  to  work  harder  at  the  relationship. \\nAnd one  day, after I had been  pulled into the middle of another \\nbout between them, I asked Mary if she could just work harder to \\nget along with Jennifer. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cManaging the Gatekeeper—Artfully \\n\\n89 \\n\\nMary didn\\'t take my suggestion well.  Before  long,  getting  on \\nPat\\'s calendar became more and more difficult. Bypassing corpo \\nrate  bureaucracy,  which  was  a  breeze  in  the  past,  now  became \\nimpossible. My expense accounts were getting micro-scrutinized, \\ntaking up my time, and the pressure on Jennifer was greater than \\never, which made her react even worse. \\n\\nI\\'d had enough. I went up to Pat\\'s office and said bluntly, \"Look, \\n\\nMary, this has to stop.\" \\n\\nIf I thought Mary had been upset before—yikes!—it was noth ', 'ing compared to her ire now. \\n\\nOffice life became a nightmare for a period of time. \\nFinally, Pat drew me aside. \"Keith,\" he said, \"you\\'ve gone about \\nthis all wrong. Now this whole ordeal  is making  my life difficult. \\nThink about it: I get to hear all this from Mary\\'s side as well about \\nyour  administrative  assistant,  and  I  don\\'t  really want  to  have  to \\ndeal with this. Second of all, you\\'re being stupid. Mary likes you \\nand  always  has.  Do yourself a favor.  Do  me a favor. Whatever  it \\ntakes,  smooth  things  over  with  Mary.  When  it  comes  to  these \\nissues, she runs this place.\" \\n\\nPersonally, I had always cared for and respected Mary, but now \\nI  learned  something  else—an  assistant  like  Mary has  enormous \\npower. Secretaries and assistants are more than just helpful associ \\nates  to  their  bosses.  If  they  are  any  good,  they  become  trusted \\nfriends,  advocates,  and  integral  parts  of  their  professional,  and ', '\\nOne day Jennifer, who was as loyal to me as Mary was to Pat, \\ncame to me and offered to resign. \"Listen, I\\'m miserable and your \\ncareer is going to be jeopardized if all this doesn\\'t get straightened \\nout,\" she told me. It was an amazingly gracious gesture, as well as \\na way to restore sanity in her life. I promised to help find Jennifer \\nanother job  (which she did quickly), and we remain good friends \\nto this day. \\n\\nWhen I went to hire my next assistant, I did two things. First, I \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c90 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nasked  if  Mary would  prescreen  all  candidates  and  rank  her  top \\nchoices. I went with her first choice. I also told my new administra \\ntive assistant to do whatever Mary instructed. It didn\\'t take long for \\nme to make up with Mary, either. Pat was right: Mary did like me \\nand I just had to better understand her role. Pat started getting my \\nmessages again and all of our lives were so much easier. \\n\\nAs  important  as  gatekeepers  are within  an  organization, they\\'re ', 'outside. \\n\\nAt about the same time, Kent Blossil, an advertising sales rep \\nresentative for Newsweek magazine, was  one  of twenty ad sales \\npeople banging  on my door looking to  make  a sale.  But I  had a \\nmedia buyer at the agency whom we paid to take those meetings \\nfor me, and as a rule, I never met with ad sales reps. \\n\\nKent was different. He knew the kind of influence a gatekeeper \\n\\nwields. \\n\\nKent would call Jennifer once a week. He was  deferential  and \\noverwhelmingly kind. Every so often, he would surprise her with \\na box of chocolates or flowers or something. Still, despite my assis \\ntant\\'s suggestions, I saw no reason to take the meeting. \\n\\nJennifer persisted, however, and Kent must\\'ve been scheduled \\ninto  my calendar  on  ten  different  occasions  without  my knowl \\nedge. Each time, I\\'d cancel. But she\\'d just keep plugging her good \\nfriend into my schedule because she felt he was different and had \\na more innovative approach than the others. \\n\\n\"Have him go meet with my buyer,\" I finally said one day. \\n\"No, you\\'re going to meet with him. You can take five minutes ', 'utes.\" So I relented. \\n\\nKent certainly was nice, but he also came to the meeting pre \\npared with a deep  understanding of my business  and an interest \\ning value proposition. At our meeting, almost the first thing out of \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cManaging the Gatekeeper—Artfully \\n\\n91 \\n\\nhis mouth was \"If it\\'s okay with you, I would like to introduce you \\nto the top three senior editors of Newsweek. Would you be inter \\nested  in  that?\" As  someone  who  relied  on  getting  the  media  to \\ncover Deloitte\\'s intellectual property, this was an important offer. \\n\\n\"Of course,\" I told him. \\n\"By the way, we\\'re having a conference in Palm Springs where \\nsome  other  CMOs  are  getting  together  with  our  editors  and \\nreporters.  It\\'s  going  to  be  a  really good  conference  about media \\nstrategies in the New Economy. Can I put you on the guest list?\" \\nHe was offering a real business value, as many of the other CMOs \\nwould also be Deloitte customers. It would be a personal network ', '\"Yeah, I\\'d like to go to that.\" \\n\"Also, I know your media guy has been evaluating a proposal \\nwe put in a few months ago. I\\'m not going to waste your time with \\nthe  details.  I just want you  to  know that  it would be  great if we \\ncould do business together sometime.\" That was it. That was Ken\\'s \\nfive-minute sales pitch. It was 98 percent value-add for me, 2 per \\ncent sales pitch by him. \\n\\nI  called  our  media  guy  after  Ken  left  my  office.  \"Go  to \\nNewsweek,\"  I  told  him.  \"Quote  them  a  fair  price  relative  to  the \\nother magazines we were considering, and give them our business \\nin  this  segment.  Make  it  work.\" And  you  know  that  when  Ken \\nwent to another magazine, so did my business. \\n\\nMy point? Always  respect the  gatekeeper\\'s  power. Treat them \\nwith the dignity they deserve. If you do, doors will open for you to \\neven  the  most  powerful  decision  makers.  What  does  it  mean  to ', \"phone, flowers, a note. \\n\\nAnd yes, there  are times, of course, where the  situation  calls  for \\nmore than niceties and pleasant gifts. At times, you'll need to use \\nstreet smarts to get a meeting. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c92 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nLast  summer,  I  met  a  former Disney executive  on  a  flight  to \\nNew York.  In the  course  of our conversation, I  mentioned that I \\nwas a fairly new transplant to Los Angeles and I was always look \\ning to meet good, smart people. She suggested that I might like to \\nget to know an up-and-coming executive by the name of Michael \\nJohnson, the president of Walt Disney International. \\n\\nThere wasn't  anything  obvious  that  Johnson  could  do  for  my \\ncompany or me  at that point, but I  felt he was  someone  I  should \\nmeet. I was  running a computer games company, and who  could \\nsay  whether  Disney  might  someday  be  interested  in  the  video \\ngames space. The only problem was getting through Johnson's gate \", '\\nI  called  Michael  Johnson  when  I  got  home  from  my travels \\n\\nand, unsurprisingly, got a neutral to cold reception. \\n\\n\"I\\'m  sorry,  Mr.  Johnson  is  traveling,  and  he\\'ll  be  gone  all \\n\\nmonth,\" his administrative assistant told me. \\n\\n\"That\\'s  okay,\"  I  replied. \"Why don\\'t you  tell  him  a  friend  of \\nJane  Pemberton\\'s  called.  Please tell him to  call me back when he \\ngets a chance.\" \\n\\nWith  a  first  call  you  don\\'t  want  to  come  off  as  aggressive. \\n\\nRemember, you never, ever want to anger the gatekeeper. \\n\\nMy second call was more of the same: establishing my presence \\n\\nand making it known I wouldn\\'t go away. \\n\\n\"Hi, this is Keith Ferrazzi. I\\'m just calling back because I haven\\'t \\nheard  from  Michael.\" Here,  again, without  being  too  pushy, you \\nbegin to  create the  presumption that his  return  call is imminent \\nand  expected.  Johnson\\'s  gatekeeper  politely took  down  my mes ', 'she wouldn\\'t give it to me, stating privacy concerns. \\n\\nOn the third attempt, she was less polite. \"Listen,\" she told me \\nwith  a  little  edge  in  her voice, \"Mr.  Johnson  is  very busy and  I \\ndon\\'t know who you are.\" Now, I could either match her tone and \\nthis would spiral downward, or ... \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cManaging the Gatekeeper—Artfully \\n\\n93 \\n\\n\"Oh, I\\'m really sorry, I\\'m a personal friend of a friend of his. I \\njust moved  into  the  city,  and  Jane  suggested  that  I  should  meet \\nMichael, and honestly, I don\\'t even know why besides the fact that \\nJane is a good friend of Michael\\'s. Maybe you\\'re right. Maybe it\\'s \\nall wrong. Maybe Michael doesn\\'t know Jane well and he wouldn\\'t \\nwant to meet me. I apologize if this is the case.\" \\n\\nBy being so candid and even vulnerable, I put the assistant on \\nalert.  She  now  fears  that  perhaps  she\\'s  been  too  gruff,  perhaps \\ninappropriate, to a friend of a friend of her boss. After all, I\\'m just ', 'ried that she\\'s closed the gate too tight. Then I made a suggestion: \\n\"Why don\\'t I just send Michael an e-mail?\" And at this point, she\\'s \\nthinking, \"I want to be out of the middle of this thing.\" So, finally, \\nI got his e-mail address. \\n\\nThe  e-mail  I  sent was  simple: \"Dear Michael, I\\'m  a friend of \\nJane\\'s, and she suggested I talk with you . .. Jane thinks we should \\nknow  each  other.\"  If  I  had  had  something  specific  to  discuss,  I \\nwould have put it right up  front, but the best value  proposition I \\nhad was the mutual friend who felt this would be a win-win. \\n\\nIt\\'s sometimes effective to utilize several forms of communica \\ntion when trying to  reach  an  important new contact. An  e-mail, \\nletter, fax, or postcard often has a better chance of landing directly \\nin the hands of the person you\\'re trying to reach. \\n\\nJohnson\\'s  reply was  cordial  and short. \"When  convenient, I\\'d \\n\\nbe happy to meet.\" \\n\\nSo  I  went  back  to  his  assistant  with  the  information  that ', \"find out when.

It means that you should always be reaching out to others, \\nover breakfast, lunch, whatever. It means that if one meeting hap \\npens to go sour, you have six other engagements lined up just like \\nit the rest of the week. \\n\\nIn  building  a  network,  remember:  Above  all,  never,  ever \\n\\ndisappear. \\n\\nKeep your social and conference and event calendar full.

A few years back, \\n\\nI got the opportunity to travel with then First Lady Hillary Clin \\nton on a C130 troop carrier, crisscrossing the Southwest from one \\npolitical  event  to  another.  She  was  up  at  5  in  the  morning  for \\nbreakfast and phone calls back to the East Coast. She gave at least \\nfour  or five speeches,  attended  a  few  cocktail  parties  where  she \\nconstantly reached out to scores of individuals, and visited several \\npeople's  homes.  She  must  have  touched  2,000  hands  that  day \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cNever Eat Alone \\n\\n95 \\n\\nalone. At the end of the night, when most of our entourage strug \\ngled to  get back on Air  Force  One,  she  huddled her  staff,  sat  up \\ncross-legged, and began to joke and chitchat with them  about all \\nthat happened that day. An hour or so of frivolity, and Mrs. Clin \\nton  moved  on  to  scheduling  the  next  day.  No  matter what your \", \"work  ethic.  I  was  shocked  by  the  number  of  individuals  she \\nremembered by name along the trip. I was having a tough enough \\ntime with remembering everyone's name in our group. \\n\\nI  see  examples  of this  kind  of persistence  and  determination \\neverywhere. My particular heroes, because of my background, are \\nthose people who came from humble origins. A fellow CEO friend \\ncame  from  a blue-collar  family  in  the  Midwest—his  father,  like \\nmine, was  a laborer for forty-odd years. He'll tell you he isn't the \\nsmartest guy in the room, he doesn't have the Ivy League pedigree \\nof his colleagues, and he hasn't climbed the greasy pole by getting \\na boost from his family. But today, he is one of the most respected \\nCEOs in his industry. \\n\\nHis formula is not complicated, but it is rigorous. He talks to at \\nleast fifty people  each  day.  He  spends  hours  a week walking  his \\ncompany plant talking  to  employees  up  and  down the ladder.  If \\nyou send an e-mail to him or his assistant, you can be sure there \", \"blue-collar work ethic and sensibilities he was raised with  by his \\nfather. About his  more  starched white-collar  colleagues, he  once \\ntold me that while he had learned what these people know, they \\nwould never have an opportunity to learn what he knew. \\n\\nNow, you have  to  work  hard to  be  successful  at  reaching  out \\nto  others,  but  that  doesn't  mean  you  have  to  work  long.  There \\nis  a  difference.  Some  people  think  building  a  network  requires \\neighteen-hour days slogging through meetings and phone calls. If \\nI'm  slogging,  or  even  if it  feels  like  slogging,  I'm  not  doing  my \\njob—at least not well. Or perhaps I'm in the wrong job.

Someone once remarked cynically, \"I\\'d have to clone myself \\nto take all the meetings you take.\" \\n\\n\"Ah,  you\\'re  onto  something,\"  I  responded.  \"I  don\\'t  clone \\n\\nmyself. I clone the event.\" \\n\\nHere\\'s what I mean. A few months ago, I flew into New York for \\na two-day business stint. There were a number of people I wanted \\nto see: an old client and friend of mine who was the former presi \\ndent of Lego and was now trying to figure out what he wanted to do \\nwith the rest of his life, the COO of Broadway Video, with whom I \\nwanted to discuss a new branded entertainment TV show for one of \\nmy clients, and a close friend that I hadn\\'t seen in too long. \\n\\nI  had  two  days,  three  people  I  wanted  to  see,  and  only  one \\navailable time slot to see them all. How do you manage a situation \\nlike this? \\n\\nI \"cloned\" the dinner and invited all of them to join me. Each \\nwould  benefit from knowing  the  others,  and  I\\'d be  able to  catch ', \"about the new TV show. My friend, who has  a fantastic sense of \\nhumor,  would  enjoy  the  group  and  add  a  little  levity  to  what \\nmight have been just a stodgy business meeting. \\n\\nI asked my friend to join me a half hour in advance at the hotel \\nI was staying at for a little one-on-one time. And if the details of \\nthe project I was  discussing with the COO were private, I might \\nschedule a little one-on-one time with him after dinner. \\n\\nThe point is I'm constantly looking to include others in what \\never  I'm  doing.  It's  good  for  them,  good  for  me,  and  good  for \\neveryone  to  broaden  their  circle  of friends.  Sometimes  I'll  take \\npotential employees for a workout and conduct the interview over \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cNever Eat Alone \\n\\n97 \\n\\na  run.  As  a  makeshift  staff  meeting,  I'll  occasionally  ask  a  few \\nemployees to  share a car ride with me to the airport.

As  Robert \\nMetcalfe,  the  inventor  of Ethernet,  says:  The value  of a  network \\ngrows proportional to the square of the number of its users. In the \\ncase  of the  Internet,  every new computer,  every new server,  and \\nevery new user  added  expands  the  possibilities for everyone  else \\nwho\\'s  already  there.  The  same  principle  holds  true  in  growing \\nyour web of relationships. The bigger it gets, the more attractive it \\nbecomes, and the faster it grows. That\\'s why I say that a network is \\nlike a muscle—the more you work it, the bigger it gets. \\n\\nSuch cloning is also a good way to ensure that a meeting or get-\\ntogether  is  worthwhile.  If  I\\'m  meeting  someone  whom  I  don\\'t \\nknow that well,  I  might  invite  someone  I  do  know just to  make \\nsure the meeting does not become a waste of time.

In most cases, \\nthey end up contributing something to the meeting as well. Don't \\nunderestimate young people's ability to find creative new insight. \\nWhen  you  try this  sort  of thing,  pay special  attention  to  the \\nchemistry between people. Do you have a sense of who will get on \\nwell with each other? It doesn't mean that everyone has to have the \\nsame  background  and  sensibility.  In  fact,  a  nice  mix of different \\nprofessions and personalities can be the perfect recipe for a terrific \\ngathering. Trust your instincts. One litmus test I often use is to ask \\nmyself if I think I'll have fun.

There  is  a  misconception  that  to \\nbuild  a  bond,  two  people  need  to  spend  a  great  deal  of  time \\ntogether. This is not the case. Outside your family and work, you \\nprobably can count the people you see a great deal of in the course \\nof a  month  on  two  hands. Yet,  surely,  you  have  more  than  ten \\nfriends.

We thought a conference \\nmight be a great way to introduce our relationship with  Michael \\nto the market, strengthen our brand, and win a few customers to \\nboot.  So we  proposed a joint conference hosted by Deloitte and \\nMichael Hammer. We would bring the industry expertise and case \\nstudies,  and  Michael  would  bring  his  expertise  in  reengineering \\nand his understanding of how to run a world-class conference. \\n\\nIt gave me a chance to see the inner workings of how a success \\nful conference is orchestrated and of course build a great relation \\nship with Mike. I became acutely aware of how powerful it was to \\nknow,  in  advance, who  would be  attending; why some  speakers \\nwere  chosen  and some were not;  and what the best forums were \\nfor networking. \\n\\nFrom  the  outset,  our  idea  was  to  apply  some  method  to  the \\nusual conference madness. A tracking system was put in place that ', \"selves. Each Deloitte partner's objective was to meet two people who \\nwere assigned to them from the guests we knew would be attending. \\nEach was given one person as a primary target—someone we really \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c114 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nwanted  to  win  as  a  client.  The  other  person  was  someone  we \\nthought Deloitte would benefit from knowing, perhaps  a member \\nof the media. The basic goal remained, quite simply, to meet new \\npeople. \\n\\nBecause we knew who was attending beforehand, the partners \\ngot a one-page bio on the people assigned them, listing who they \\nwere, what they did, their accomplishments and hobbies, and the \\npotential  challenges  their  company faced  that  Deloitte  might  be \\nable to address. This was enough information to make a real con \\nnection when the partner finally met the individual. \\n\\nWe also gave the partners a list of ideas of how to actually catch \\nup  with  their  targets  and  what  to  say when  they  met  them.  At \\nthe  end  of each  day, the  partners  would  report whom  they met, \", \"time meeting their target person, we strategized for the next day, \\nmaking  sure  that  the  partner  and  the  individual  they  were \\nassigned  to  would  sit  at  the  same  dinner  table  the  following \\nevening, or I'd make a point of making the introduction myself, or \\nwe'd ask Mike to make an intro in a few cases. \\n\\nWhat  I  had  unknowingly  created  was  a  unit  of  conference \\ncommandos, prepared in advance with information on who they \\nwere to meet, how (we had done research), and where. The results \\nwere astounding. The conference was packed. As a result, Deloitte \\nsaw an unprecedented amount of business come its way. We have \\nsince perfected this art at FerrazziGreenlight, and not only do we \\nadvise companies on how to get the most out of their conferences, \\nbut also big conference-givers like Forbes and PeopleSoft come to \\nus to help them design conferences that will have world-class out \\ncomes for both these companies and their conference attendees. \\n\\nThe key is  to work hard to make the conference  a success for \\neveryone.

Determine  where  most people  will  gather,  or  at \\nleast pass, and station yourself there. This might be near the food \\ntable, the bar, or the reception area. \\n\\nBe on your game during these times.

The  problem  is,  if the  person  they want to  meet truly is the \\n\\nmost  important  person  at  the  conference,  that  person  will  be  on \\n\\ntheir  guard.  And  maybe  even  guarded,  literally.  A young  friend  of \\n\\nmine went  to  see  the  King  of Jordan  speak  recently  and  came  back \\n\\necstatic.  He  had  waited  an  hour  or  more,  along  with  5 00  other \\n\\npeople,  for a  chance  to  shake  the  King\\'s  hand.

How can that ', \"more people than the rest of us. \\n\\nCall them  super-connectors. We all know at least one person \\nlike  this  individual,  who  seems  to  know  everybody  and  who \\neverybody seems to know. You'll find a disproportionate amount \\nof super-connectors as headhunters, lobbyists, fundraisers, politi \\ncians,  journalists,  and  public  relations  specialists,  because  such \\npositions require these folks' innate abilities. I am going to argue \\nthat  such  people  should  be  the  cornerstones  to  any  flourishing \\nnetwork. \\n\\nWhat  Michael  Jordan  was  to  the  basketball  court,  or  Tiger \\nWoods is to golf, these people can be to your network. So who are \\nthey, really, and how can you get them to become prized members \\nof your circle of associates and friends? \\n\\nIn his bestselling book  The  Tipping Point,  Malcolm Gladwell \\ncites  a  classic  1974  study  by  sociologist  Mark  Granovetter  that \\nsurveyed how a  group  of men  in  Newton, Massachusetts, found \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cConnecting with Connectors \", '129 \\n\\ntheir current job.  The study, appropriately titled \"Getting a Job,\" \\nhas become a seminal work in its field, and its findings have been \\nconfirmed over and over again. \\n\\nGranovetter  discovered  that  56  percent  of  those  surveyed \\nfound their current job through  a personal  connection.  Only  19 \\npercent  used  what  we  consider  traditional  job-searching  routes, \\nlike  newspaper job  listings  and  executive  recruiters.  Roughly  10 \\npercent applied directly to an employer and obtained the job. \\n\\nMy point?  Personal  contacts  are the key to  opening  doors— \\nnot such a revolutionary idea. What is surprising, however, is that \\nof those personal  connections  that reaped dividends for those in \\nthe  study,  only  17  percent  saw their  personal  contact  often—as \\nmuch  as  they would  if they were  good  friends—and  55  percent \\nsaw their contact only occasionally. And get this, 28 percent barely \\nmet with their contact at all. \\n\\nIn other words, it\\'s not necessarily strong contacts, like family \\nand  close  friends, that  prove  the  most  powerful;  to  the  contrary, ', 'acquaintances. \\n\\nAs a result of the study, Granovetter immortalized the phrase \\n\"the  strength  of weak ties\" by showing  persuasively that when it \\ncomes  to  finding  out  about  new jobs—or,  for  that  matter,  new \\ninformation or new ideas—\"weak ties\" are generally more impor \\ntant than those you consider strong. Why is that? Think about it. \\nMany of your closest friends and contacts go to the same parties, \\ngenerally do the same work, and exist in roughly the same world \\nas  you  do.  That\\'s  why they  seldom  know  information  that  you \\ndon\\'t already know. \\n\\nYour weak ties, on the other hand, generally occupy a very dif \\nferent world than you do. They\\'re hanging out with different peo \\nple, often in different worlds, with access to a whole inventory of \\nknowledge  and  information  unavailable  to  you  and  your  close \\nfriends. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c130 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nMom was wrong—it does pay to talk to strangers. As Malcolm \\nGladwell  wrote,  \"Acquaintances,  in  short,  represent  a  source  of ', 'powerful you are.\" \\n\\nThroughout  this  book,  I  try  to  emphasize  that  what\\'s  most \\nimportant  is  developing  deep  and  trusting  relationships,  not \\nsuperficial  contacts.  Despite  Granovetter\\'s  research,  I  believe \\nfriendships  are the foundation for a truly powerful  network.  For \\nmost of us, cultivating a lengthy list of mere acquaintances on top \\nof the effort devoted to your circle of friends is just too  draining. \\nThe  thought  of being  obligated  to  another  hundred  or  so  peo \\nple—sending birthday cards, dinner invites, and all that stuff that \\nwe do for those close to us—seems outlandishly taxing. \\n\\nOnly,  for  some,  it\\'s  not.  These  people  are  super-connectors. \\nPeople like me who  maintain  contact with  thousands  of people. \\nThe key, however, is not only that we know thousands of people \\nbut that we know thousands  of people in many different worlds, \\nand we  know them  well  enough  to  give  them  a  call.  Once  you ', 'away from the thousands of different people we know. \\n\\nA  social  psychologist  by  the  name  of  Dr.  Stanley  Milgram \\nproved this idea in a 1967 study. He ran an experiment that set out \\nto show that our big, impersonal world is actually quite small and \\nfriendly. \\n\\nIt  was  Milgram\\'s  experiment  that  created  the  notion  of \"six \\ndegrees  of separation.\" In the experiment, he sent a package to  a \\nfew  hundred  randomly  selected  people  in  Nebraska  with  the \\ninstructions  that  they  forward  the  package  to  an  anonymous \\nstockbroker  in  Boston  whom  they  did  not  know.  Each  person \\ncould send the packet only to someone whom they knew on a first-\\nname  basis,  and who  they thought was  more  likely to  know the \\nstockbroker than they were themselves. About a third of the letters \\nreached their destination, after an average of only six mailings. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cConnecting with Connectors \\n\\n131 \\n\\nWhat was surprising was that when all those chains of people ', \"through  the  hands  of  the  same  three  Nebraskans.  The  finding \\ndrives home the point that if you want access to the social power \\nof acquaintances, it helps to know a few super-connectors. \\n\\nConnectors  can be found in  every imaginable  profession, but \\nI'm  going  to  focus  on  seven  professions  where  they  most  com \\nmonly congregate. Each of these kinds of connectors provides me \\nwith  a link to  an  entire world  of people,  ideas,  and  information \\nthat, in a very significant way, has made my own life a little more \\nfun, helped my career along, or made the businesses I worked for \\nmore  successful. \\n\\n1. Restaurateurs \\n\\nFifty-seventh  Street  isn't  exactly  lower  Manhattan,  but  it  was \\ndowntown  to  Jimmy  Rodriguez,  the  nightlife  impresario  who \\nmade  the  Bronx  hip  for  the  A-list  with  his  first  eatery.  Jimmy's \\nDowntown, his second restaurant, lured the same set of celebrities, \", \"\\nWhen I was in New York, it was my spot. The scene was exclu \\nsive without being pompous: soft light, a gleaming onyx bar, and \\na pumping R&B soundtrack makes the place feel like a hip coun \\ntry club. Jimmy would fly around tables hooking you up with free \\nappetizers  and  introducing you  to  people  he  thought you  might \\nwant to meet. \\n\\nIt was like a private club, without membership dues. \\nMy memories of Jimmy were of a true-blue connector. In fact, \\nit's a requisite for most people who own restaurants. When I was \\nin Chicago, it was Gordon's Restaurant, and in L.A., it is Wolfgang \\nPuck. The success of their enterprise depends on a core group of \\nregulars who see the restaurant as a home away from home. \\n\\nAnd  it's  quite  easy to  get  to  know  a  restaurateur.  The  smart \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c132 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nones will go out of their way to make your experience delightful. \\nAll you have to do is reach out and go there often enough. \\n\\nWhen in a new city, I generally ask people to give me a list of a \", \"ahead and ask to speak with the owner  (though the maitre d' will \\ndo)  and tell them that I go out regularly, sometimes in large par \\nties, and I'm looking for a new place to entertain, a lot! \\n\\nIf you don't go out as often as I do, find one or two restaurants \\nthat you enjoy and frequent them when you do go out. Become a \\nregular. Make a point of meeting the staff. When you're entertain \\ning for work, bring others there. When you have to cater an event, \\nuse them. \\n\\nOnce you  get  to  know the  owner,  it'll  become  like your very \\nown  restaurant—a  place  that  has  the  patina  of  exclusivity  and \\ncachet a private club imparts with all the warmth and comfort of \\nyour own home. \\n\\nWith some advance planning and a little loyalty, a restaurateur \\nwill not only share the bounty of his kitchen with you but intro \\nduce you to his other roster of clients as well. \\n\\n2.  Headhunters \\n\\nRecruiters. Job-placement counselors. Search executives. They are \\nlike gatekeepers. Instead of answering to  one executive, however, \", \"the field in which they recruit. \\n\\nHeadhunters  are  professional  matchmakers,  earning  their \\nwage by introducing job candidates to companies that are hiring. \\nShould you get the job, the headhunter gets a sizable commission, \\ntypically  a  percentage  of  the  successful  candidate's  first  year's \\ncompensation. \\n\\nAs  a result, headhunters  are an interesting blend of salesman \\nand socialite. To find candidates, headhunters often place job ads. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cConnecting with Connectors \\n\\n133 \\n\\nThey also contact likely candidates directly, perhaps on the refer \\nral of a friend or colleague. In the industries in which they special \\nize, they become invaluable resources of names and information. \\nThe  sweet  spot  for  a headhunter  revolves  around two  issues. \\nYou're either hiring them to do a search or you're helping them do \\na  search  on  behalf of someone  else.  If you're  in the market for  a \\njob, let as many search firms as are willing hit the phones for you. \\nI  keep  a file of headhunters:  who  they are  and  what  they're \", 'network to find people for their jobs. I know they\\'ll help me with \\naccess  to  some  of their  clients  when  I  need  their  help. After  all, \\nthey are in the networking business! \\n\\nCan anyone contact a headhunter? To be honest, headhunters \\nprefer to be the one contacting you. But if you\\'re careful about not \\ntrying to sell yourself before you offer up the network of contacts \\nyou can  provide to  them,  they\\'ll  be  receptive.  In  the  early years \\nof my career, when  I was  not in the  position  of hiring them  and \\ndidn\\'t know people who  were  using  search  consultants,  I  would \\nask pointedly, \"What searches are you working on? How can I help \\nyou find people?\" \\n\\nThe other advice in this area is to act as a pseudo-headhunter \\nyourself,  always  on  the  lookout to  connect job-hunters  and job-\\nseekers or consultants and companies. When you help people land \\na new gig, they\\'ll  be  inclined to  remember you if they hear  of a \\nnew  position  opening.  Moreover,  if you  help,  say,  a  vendor  of ', 'ing prices on your next project. Helping others find good employ \\nees is a real currency. \\n\\n3. Lobbyists \\n\\nWell informed, persuasive, and self-confident, lobbyists are gener \\nally impressive networkers. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c134 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nBy  virtue  of  their  job,  they  are  intimately  familiar  with  the \\nways  of large  organizations  and how local  and national  govern \\nment work.  They are  almost  uniformly passionate  people whose \\ngoal is to sway politicians to vote on legislation in a way that favors \\nthe interest they represent. \\n\\nHow do they work? Lobbyists will often host cocktail parties and \\ndinner get-togethers, allowing them to interact with  politicians— \\nand their  opponents—in  a  casual  atmosphere.  Their more  grass \\nroots efforts involve long hours spent on the phone and in writing \\nletters, trying  to  rouse  the  community to  get  involved  behind  an \\nissue. All of which makes them a rather easy group to please. Can \\nyou hold  an  event for them? Volunteer your  services?  Refer  other \\nvolunteers to their cause? Introduce them to potential clients? ', 'Lobbyists tend to bump up against a lot of people who it might \\nbe helpful to know, including those who are powerful and successful. \\n\\n4. Fundraisers \\n\\n\"Follow  the  money\"  are  words  fundraisers  live  by.  They  know \\nwhere it is, what it will take to get it, and most important, who\\'s \\nmost likely to  give it away. As  a result, fundraisers, whether they \\nwork for  a  political  organization,  university,  or nonprofit  group, \\ntend  to  know  absolutely  everybody.  And  while  they  have  the \\nunenviable job of trying to convince people every day to part with \\ntheir well-earned  money,  they are  almost  always  incredibly well \\nliked. It\\'s a selfless job often done for the best of reasons, and most \\npeople  recognize  that  anyone  who  has  a  good  friend  who  is  a \\nfundraiser has an open door to a whole new world of contacts and \\nopportunities. \\n\\n5. Public  relations people \\n\\nPR  people  spend  their  whole  day  calling,  cajoling,  pressuring, ', '\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cConnecting with Connectors \\n\\n135 \\n\\nbetween media and PR is an uneasy one, but at the end of the day, \\nnecessity brings them together like long-lost cousins. \\n\\nA  good friend who  works  in  PR can  be your  entree  into  the \\nworld  of media  and,  sometimes,  celebrity. Elana Weiss, who  co-\\nleads the PR firm I used called The Rose Group, introduced me to \\nArianna  Huffington  (through  someone  she  knew  in  her  office), \\nthe  noted  author  and  political  columnist.  Arianna  has  since \\nbecome a friend and confidante and one  of the  dazzling lights at \\nmy dinner parties in L.A. \\n\\n6. Politicians \\n\\nPoliticians  at every level are inveterate networkers.  They have to \\nbe. They shake hands, kiss babies, give speeches, and go to dinners, \\nall  in  the  name  of  gaining  the  trust  of  enough  people  to  get \\nelected.  The  stature  of politicians  is  derived  from  their  political ', \"gain power with voters, or exercise power in office, will go a long \\nway to ensuring you a place in their inner circle. \\n\\nWhat can a politician do for you? Local city hall politicians can \\nbe  key  to  working  through  the  thicket  of  local  governmental \\nbureaucracy. And politicians at any level, if successful, are celebri \\nties—and their networks reflect that. \\n\\nHow  can  you  reach  out?  Join  your  local  Chamber  of  Com \\nmerce. Local executives, businesspeople, and entrepreneurs gener \\nally populate the Chamber. In every community, there are plenty \\nof young politicos looking to climb the political ladder. Early on, \\nbefore their rise to prominence, you can engender a lot of loyalty \\nand  trust  by  supporting  their  goals  and  chipping  in  when  they \\ndecide to  run for office. \\n\\n7.

Go  door-to-door, \\n\\ngreeting  one  resident  at  a  time?  Or  would  you  try  to  find  one \\n\\nplugged-in  resident who  could  open  all  the  doors  for you? \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cConnecting with  Connectors \\n\\n137 \\n\\nThe  answer  is  clear. \\n\\nToday,  that  plugged-in  townie  might  be,  say,  the  high  school \", \"principal,  the  Little  League  commissioner,  or  the  church  pastor.  But \\n\\nin  Paul  Revere's  day—think  of  the  1770s  in  the  Boston  metro \\n\\narea—the  most  plugged-in  people  were  like  Revere,  the  owner  of \\n\\na  silversmith  shop  in  the  city's  North  End,  businessmen  and  mer \\n\\nchants  who  dealt  with  individuals  at  every  level  of  Boston  society \\n\\nand  culture. \\n\\nRevere  was  also  an  extremely  social  individual:  He  formed  sev \\n\\neral  clubs  of  his  own  and  joined  many  others.  As  a  teenager,  he \\n\\nand  six  friends  formed  a  society of church  bell  ringers;  as  an  adult, \\n\\nhe  joined  the  North  Caucus  Club,  a  society  founded  by  Samuel \\n\\nAdams's  father  to  choose  candidates  for  local  government. \\n\\nIn \\n\\n1774, when  British  troops  began  to seize  munitions,  Revere  formed \", 'yet another club,  of sorts,  responsible  for  monitoring  the  movements \\n\\nof  British  troops.  In  addition,  Revere  belonged  to  the  Masonic \\n\\nLodge  of St.  Andrew,  through which  he was friendly with  revolution \\n\\nary activists  such  as James  Otis  and  Dr. Joseph  Warren. \\n\\nAll  of which  helps  to  explain  why  Revere,  among  all  Bostonians \\n\\nin  the  year  preceding  the  Revolution,  served  as  courier  for  the \\n\\nBoston  Committee  of Correspondence  and  the  Massachusetts  Com \\n\\nmittee  of  Safety,  riding  express  to  the  Continental  Congress  in \\n\\nPhiladelphia.  It was  also  he who  spread  the word  of the  Boston  Tea \\n\\nParty  to  New  York  and  Philadelphia.  Revere,  in  short,  was  a  man \\n\\nwho  knew  not  only  people—he  knew  gossip,  he  knew  rumors,  he \\n\\nknew  news,  and  he  knew  it  from  every  level  of  Boston  society. ', 'In  April  1775,  Revere  caught  wind  of  British  orders  to  capture \\n\\nrebel  leaders  and  forcibly  disarm  the  colonists.  So  Revere  and  his \\n\\nfellow  rebels  devised  a  warning  system:  Two  lanterns  shining  from \\n\\nthe  steeple  of  Boston\\'s  Old  North  Church  (the  city\\'s  tallest  building) \\n\\nindicated  that  the  British  troops  were  advancing  on  Boston  by  sea; \\n\\none  candle  indicated  a  land  advance.  Either  way,  the  rebels  in \\n\\nBoston  and  its  surrounding  suburbs  would  know  when  and  where \\n\\nto  flee  and  take  up  arms. \\n\\nWe  all  know  the  \"one  if by  land,  two  if  by sea\"  part of this  story. \\n\\nWhat\\'s  less  known \\n\\nis  that  Revere\\'s  networking  savvy  is  what \\n\\nallowed  him—and  maybe  only  him—to  be  the  one  entrusted  with ', \"illuminating  the  church  steeple. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c138 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nThe  church,  as  it  happened,  was  Anglican;  the  rector  strongly \\n\\nsupported  the Crown.  But Revere  knew the vestryman, John  Pulling, \\n\\nthrough  the  North  Caucus Club.  And  through  his  shop,  he  knew the \\n\\nsexton,  Robert  Newman,  who  had  a  key to  the  building. \\n\\nRevere's  connections  were  crucial  to  him  that  fateful  night.  After \\n\\nlighting  the  lanterns,  Revere  needed  to  reach  Lexington,  to  warn \\n\\nrebel  leaders  Sam  Adams  and  John  Hancock.  First,  two  acquain \\n\\ntances  rowed  Revere  across  the  Charles  River,  to  Charlestown; \\n\\nthere,  a  horse  was  waiting  for  Revere,  lent  to  him  by  another  pal, \\n\\nDeacon John  Larkin. \", \"Chased  by  Redcoats,  Revere was  diverted  north  of  Lexington,  to \\n\\nthe  town  of Medford.  Because  he  knew  the  head  of Medford's  mil \\n\\nitary,  Revere  rode  to  his  house  and  warned  him.  With  the  militia \\n\\nman's  help,  Revere  alerted  the  town  of Medford  before  heading  to \\n\\nLexington. \\n\\nMost of us  know the  Lexington  part of the story.  Less  known  is that \\n\\non  the same  night that Revere  made  his  midnight ride,  a  man  named \\n\\nWilliam  Dawes went galloping  off in  the other direction  to  muster the \\n\\nmilitias  to  the west of Boston.  Revere's  ride  stirred  up  an  army,  while \\n\\nsomething  like  three  people  showed  up  from  the  towns  Dawes  vis \\n\\nited.  Why?  Revere  was  a  connector:  He  knew  everybody,  and  so \\n\\nwas  able  to  storm  into  one village  after  another,  banging  on  all  the \", 'right  doors  and  calling  out  all  the  right  people  by  name. \\n\\nHistorians  say  Revere  was  blessed  with  an  \"uncanny  genius  for \\n\\nbeing  at  the  center  of  events.\"  But  it  doesn\\'t  take  genius  for  that— \\n\\njust involvement and  active  interest  in  your community and  a  friend \\n\\nship  (or  two)  with  a  connector. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cC H A P T ER  1  6 \\n\\nExpanding Your Circle \\n\\nThe most efficient way to  enlarge and tap  the full potential of \\n\\nyour circle of friends  is, quite simply, to  connect your circle \\nwith  someone  else\\'s.  I  don\\'t  think  of  a  network  of people  as  a \\n\"net,\" into which you wrangle contacts like a school of struggling \\ncod. Again, it\\'s like the Internet, an interconnecting series of links \\nin which each link works collaboratively to strengthen and expand \\nthe overall community. \\n\\nSuch collaboration means seeing each person in your network \\nas a partner. Like a business in which cofounders take responsibil ', 'each other, and by extension their respective networks, by taking \\nresponsibility for that part of the web that is theirs and providing \\naccess  to  it  as  needed.  In  other words,  they exchange  networks. \\nThe boundaries of any network are fluid and constantly open. \\n\\nLet me give you an example of what I mean from my own life. \\nOne Saturday afternoon, I went to join my friend Tad and his wife \\nCaroline at the Hotel Bel-Air in Los Angeles. Tad introduced me \\nto  Lisa, the manager of the hotel, who  cuts  a  striking  pose:  tall, \\nblond, articulate, charming, funny, and casual all at the same time. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c140 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\n\"If between the two of you there\\'s someone in L.A. you don\\'t \\nknow, I\\'ll be very surprised,\" Tad told us. In his eyes, we were both \\nmaster networkers. Lisa was, as many in the hospitality business \\nare, a super-connector. \\n\\nWithin ten  minutes  of meeting each  other, we knew we were \\n\\ngoing to be great friends. Lisa and I spoke the same language. ', 'Lisa  had  heard  about  the  dinner  parties  I  regularly threw for \\nbusiness. Your guests should be staying at the Bel-Air during their \\nL.A. jaunts, she told me. I, in turn, looked around the Bel-Air and \\nthought how memorable it would be to hold some of my events in \\nsuch  swanky surroundings.  Could Lisa and  I  form a social  part \\nnership? \\n\\nSo I made a simple suggestion. \\n\"Lisa,  let\\'s  share  a few months  of dinner  parties. You  hold  a \\ndinner party at the Bel-Air and give me half the invite list. Then I\\'ll \\nhold one  of my dinner parties  and  give you half of the list. We\\'ll \\nsplit the tab for each event, saving each of us a bundle of money, \\nand together we\\'ll meet a lot of new, exciting people. By cohosting \\nthe events, we\\'ll make them that much more successful.\" \\n\\nLisa agreed, and our dinner parties were a huge  success. The \\nunique mix of people from the worlds of business and entertain \\nment  was  fun  and  interesting.  Not  only  did  we  introduce  our ', 'parties was exhilarating. \\n\\nthe \\n\\nPoliticians, \\n\\ninveterate  masters  of  networking,  have \\nexchanged  their  networks  in  this  fashion  for  years.  They  have \\nwhat are called \"host committees,\" groups of people hailing from \\ndifferent  social  worlds  who  are loyal  to  a  specific  politician  and \\ncharged with introducing their candidate to their respective circle \\nof friends.  A  typical  well-established  politician  will  have  a  host \\ncommittee  of  doctors,  lawyers,  insurance  professionals,  college \\nkids,  and  so  on.  Each  committee  is  made  up  of well-connected \\npeople in their respective worlds who organize parties and events \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cExpanding Your Circle \\n\\n141 \\n\\ngranting the politician access to  all their friends. To my mind, it \\noffers  a  great  template  for  people  looking  to  expand  their  own \\nnetwork. \\n\\nAre  there  worlds  you  want  more  access  to?  If so,  see  if you \\ncan  find  a  central  figure  within  that  world  to  act  as  your  own ', 'selling  a  new product  that your  company is  introducing  several \\nmonths  down  the  line,  and  most  of  your  customers  will  be \\nlawyers.  Go to your personal  lawyer, tell him  about the  product, \\nand ask him or her if they\\'d be willing to come to a dinner with a \\nfew of their lawyer friends  that you\\'d like  to  host.  Tell  them  that \\nnot only will they get an early look at this fabulous new product, \\nbut they\\'ll have  an  opportunity to  meet your friends, who  could \\nbecome potential clients. They\\'ll become responsible for holding \\nevents  that  will  usher  you  into  their  group  of  friends.  You\\'ll \\nbecome  responsible for doing the  same for them.

This is not a free-for-all. You should \\nbe aware of who in your network is interested in being contacted \\nand  how.  Exchanging  contacts  should  take  place  around  specific \\nevents, functions,  or causes.  Consider  carefully how your partner \\nwants to use your network and how you expect to use his.

But having it and \\nknowing how to work it is the difference between  going through \\nlife  in  the  shadows  and  commanding  center  stage  wherever you \\nhappen to be. \\n\\nSo  you  weren't born  with  that  essential  ingredient  of charm, \\n\\nthe gift of gab. So what? Few are. \\n\\nWe've  all  struggled  with  that  ancient  fear  of walking  into  a \\nroom full of complete strangers and having nothing to say. Instead \\nof looking out at a sea of potential new friends and associates, we \\nsee terrifying obstacles to the wet bar. It happens at business meet \\nings,  conferences,  PTA meetings,  and  in just  about  every forum \\nwhere being social matters. That's why small talk is so important. \\nThat's also why, for those of us without a knack for small talk, sit \\nuations such as these that can help us meet so many others are also \\nthe situations that make us feel the most naked and uneasy. \", \"And in this area, technology hasn't helped one bit. Wallflowers \\nsee e-mail and instant messaging as a nifty escape hatch from hav \\ning to interact with others. The truth is, however, that these new \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c144 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nmodes  of  communication  aren't  particularly  good  for  creating \\nnew  relationships.  The  digital  medium  is  all  about  speed  and \\nbrevity.  It  may make  communication  efficient, but  it's  not  effec \\ntive when it comes to making friends. \\n\\nYet  some  are  able  to  negotiate  social  situations  with  relative \\n\\nease. How do they do it? \\n\\nThe  answer,  most  people  assume,  is  that the  ability to  make \\nsuccessful small talk is somehow innate, is something you're born \\nwith. While comforting, this assumption is entirely untrue. Con \\nversation  is  an  acquired skill.  If you have the  determination  and \\nthe proper information, just like any other skill, it can be learned. \\nThe problem  is  that so  much  of the  information  out there is \", 'terse, bottom-line behavior.  They proudly assert their disinterest \\nin \"playing the game\"; they revel in their inability to be anything \\nbut gruff. \\n\\nBut the fact is that small talk—the kind that happens between \\ntwo  people  who  don\\'t know  each  other—is  the  most  important \\ntalk we do. Language is the most direct and effective method for \\ncommunicating  our  objectives.  When  playwrights  and  screen \\nwriters  develop  characters  for  their  work,  the  first  thing  they \\nestablish is motivation. What does the character want? What is he \\nor she after? What are his or her desires? The answers dictate what \\nthat character will and won\\'t say in dialogue. That exercise is not \\nparticular  to  the  dramatic  world;  it\\'s  a  reflection  of  how  we \\nhumans  are hardwired. We  use words not only to  articulate and \\nmake concrete our own deepest desires, but also to enlist others in \\nquenching those desires. \\n\\nAbout  ten  years  ago,  Thomas  Harrell,  a  professor  of applied \\npsychology at  Stanford  University  Graduate  School  of Business, ', 'ing  a  group  of MBAs  a  decade  after  their  graduation, he  found \\nthat grade-point average had no bearing on success. The one trait \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cThe Art of Small Talk \\n\\n145 \\n\\nthat was common among the class\\'s most accomplished graduates \\nwas \"verbal fluency.\" Those that had built businesses and climbed \\nthe  corporate  ladder with  amazing  speed were  those who  could \\nconfidently  make  conversation  with  anyone  in  any  situation. \\nInvestors, customers, and bosses  posed no more of a threat than \\ncolleagues,  secretaries,  and friends.  In  front  of an  audience,  at  a \\ndinner, or in a cab, these people knew how to talk. \\n\\nAs  Harrell\\'s  study  confirmed,  the  more  successfully you  use \\n\\nlanguage, the faster you can get ahead in life. \\n\\nSo what should your objective be in making small talk? Good \\nquestion. The goal is simple:  Start a conversation, keep  it going, \\ncreate a bond, and leave with the other person thinking, \"I dig that ', \"you want to use. \\n\\nA lot has been said about how one should go about doing that. \\nBut in my opinion, the experts  have  gotten wrong the one thing \\nthat works the best. The first thing small-talk experts tend to do is \\nplace  rules  around what  can  and  can't  be  said.  They  claim  that \\nwhen you first meet a person, you should avoid unpleasant, overly \\npersonal, and highly controversial issues. \\n\\nWrong! Don't listen to these people! Nothing has contributed \\nmore to the development of boring chitchatters  everywhere. The \\nnotion that everyone can be everything to everybody at all times is \\ncompletely  off  the  mark.  Personally,  I'd  rather  be  interested  in \\nwhat someone was  saying, even  if I  disagreed, than be catatonic \\nany day. \\n\\nWhen it comes to making an impression, differentiation is the \\nname  of  the  game.  Confound  expectation.  Shake  it  up.  How? \\nThere's one guaranteed way to stand out in the professional world: \\nBe yourself. I believe that vulnerability—yes, vulnerability—is one \\nof the most underappreciated assets in business today. \", \"Too  many people  confuse  secrecy with  importance.

Power,  today,  comes  from  sharing  informa \\ntion, not withholding it. More than ever, the lines demarcating the \\npersonal and the professional have blurred. We're an open-source \\nsociety, and that calls for open-source behavior. And as a rule, not \\nmany secrets are worth the energy required to keep them secret. \\n\\nBeing  up  front with  people  confers  respect;  it  pays  them  the \\ncompliment of candor. The issues we all care most about are the \\nissues we all want to talk about most. Of course, this isn't a call to \\nbe  confrontational  or disrespectful. It's  a call to be honest, open, \\nand vulnerable enough to genuinely allow other people into your \\nlife so that they can be vulnerable in return. \\n\\nHow many negotiations would have ended better if both  par \\nties involved were simply honest and forthright about their needs? \", 'you more for putting your cards on the table. \\n\\nWhether  at  the  negotiating  table  or  at  the  dinner  table,  our \\npenchant for inhibition  creates  a psychological barrier that sepa \\nrates us from those we\\'d like to know better. When we leave a for \\nmal, hesitant,  and  uncomfortable  conversation where we\\'ve  held \\nback  our  true  selves,  we  console  ourselves  by  dismissing  the \\nencounter, or more often the person, by thinking, \"We had noth \\ning in common anyway.\" \\n\\nBut  the  truth  is  everyone  has  something  in  common  with \\nevery other  person. And you won\\'t  find  those  similarities  if you \\ndon\\'t  open  up  and  expose your interests  and  concerns,  allowing \\nothers to do likewise. \\n\\nThis has some comforting implications. \\nOnce you know heartfelt candor is more effective than canned \\nquips in starting a meaningful conversation, the idea of \"breaking \\nthe ice\" becomes easy.

Recently I attended a \\nConference Board meeting, an annual gathering for executives in \\nmarketing  and  communications.  As  is  the  custom,  participants \\ngather for a dinner the night before the event. \\n\\nThat night, sitting around the table were the heads of market \\ning for companies like Wal-Mart, Cigna, Lockheed, Eli Lilly, eBay, \\nand  Nissan.  All  of  them  were  people  who  managed  significant \\nmarketing  budgets.  Their  importance  to  my  business  is  signifi \\ncant. This was an occasion that called for my being at my best. \\n\\nProblem was, I left my best somewhere over Pittsburgh on the \\nflight there. The soundtrack of my life that night was the \"Blues.\" \\nHours  before,  I  had  received  the final and  definitive  e-mail  that \\nconfirmed  my worst  fears:  I  was  single  again.  I  had just  experi ', \"was in no mood to talk. \\n\\nSherry, the woman I was sitting beside, whom I had just met, \\nhad no idea I wasn't being myself. As the conversation raged on at \\nthe dinner table, I realized I was doing all the things I tell people \\nnever to do. I was hiding behind polite, inconsequential questions \\nabout nothing in particular. \\n\\nHere we were, Sherry and I, looking at each other and talking, \\nbut really saying nothing.  It was  clear we both  couldn't wait for \\nthe check. \\n\\nAt some point, I recognized how absurd I was behaving.

So  what.  They  probably \\nweren't worth knowing in the first place.  But if the risk pays  off, \\nwell,  now  you've  just  turned  a  potentially  dull  exchange  into \\nsomething interesting or even perhaps personally insightful—and \\nmore times than not, a real relationship is formed. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c148 \", 'Never Eat Alone \\n\\nIt was  at that  point that  I just  came  out  and  said what I was \\nfeeling. \"You know, Sherry, I\\'ve got to apologize.

I just had a board \\nmeeting where  my board members  put me  through the wringer. \\nMore important, I just suffered a pretty difficult breakup  and it\\'s \\nstill got me down.\" Just like that, the rabbit was out of the hat. A \\nrisky opening, a flash of vulnerability, a moment of truth, and the \\ndynamics  of our conversation changed instantly. \\n\\nSure, she could have felt uncomfortable with  such  a personal \\nadmission. Instead, it put her at ease. \"Oh my, that\\'s no problem. \\nTrust me, I understand. Everybody goes through it.

These \\ntendencies  also  fluctuate  in  different  environments.  In  new  and \\nstrange  situations, with  people we  are  unfamiliar with, our win \\ndow  remains  small;  we  reveal  little  and  expect  others  to  do  the \\nsame.

Tell me more.\" \\n\\nCONNECTORS\\'  HALL  OF  FAME  PROFILE \\n\\nDale  Carnegie  (1888-1955) \\n\\n\"Learning  to  \\'small talk\\'is  vital.\" \\n\\nThe  late  professor Thomas  Harrell  of Stanford\\'s  Graduate  School  of \\n\\nBusiness  loved  researching  the  traits  of alumni.  His chief finding,  as ', 'www.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c156 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nyou  now  know,  is  that successful  graduates  are  social,  communica \\n\\ntive,  and  outgoing.  \"Getting-along  skills,\"  more  than  anything  else, \\n\\ndetermined  who  got  ahead. \\n\\nAnd  that\\'s  why  the  legacy  of  Dale  Carnegie—the  first  person  to \\n\\nsell  small  talk  as  a  corporate  skill—remains  intact,  nearly  seven \\n\\ndecades  after  the  1936  release  of  his  bestseller  How  to  Win \\n\\nFriends  and  Influence  People. \\n\\nFor  Carnegie,  too,  small  talk  became  a  means  for  self-advance \\n\\nment. \\n\\nBorn  in  1 888,  the son  of a Missouri  pig  farmer who struggled  all \\n\\nhis  life,  Carnegie  grew  up  ashamed  of  being  poor.  The  feeling \\n\\nnever  quite  wore  off,  and,  as  a  young  man,  he  contemplated  sui ', \"cide.  When  he  was  twenty-four,  and  struggling  for  subsistence \\n\\nin  New  York  City,  Carnegie  offered  to  teach  night  classes  in \\n\\npublic speaking  at the  1 25th  Street YMCA.  Fewer than  ten  students \\n\\nattended  his  first  class.  For  weeks,  Carnegie  shared  with  his  stu \\n\\ndents  the  skills  he'd  learned  as  a  standout  high  school  debater  and \\n\\nas  a  student  at  Missouri  State  Teachers  College.  He  taught  people \\n\\nhow  to  shirk  shyness,  boost  self-confidence,  and  ease  worry,  using \\n\\nideas  that  amount,  then  and  now,  to  common  sense.  Remember \\n\\npeople's  names.  Be  a  good  listener.  Don't  criticize,  condemn,  or \\n\\ncomplain. \\n\\nAfter  his  first  several  classes,  Carnegie  ran  out  of  stories  to  tell. \\n\\nSo  he  asked  his  students  to  stand  up  and  talk about their  own  expe \", 'riences—and  offered  feedback  on  their  performances.  It  was  then \\n\\nthat  he  realized  that  as  students  overcame  their  fear  of  taking  the \\n\\nfloor,  and  became  more  comfortable  talking  openly  about  them \\n\\nselves,  their  self-confidence  rose  accordingly. \\n\\nIn  Carnegie\\'s classes,  businessmen,  salesmen,  and  other  profes \\n\\nsionals  found  a  place  devoted  to  affordable,  commonsensical  self-\\n\\nimprovement.  By  1916,  Carnegie\\'s  course  was  so  successful  that \\n\\nhe  needed  to  train,  for  the  first  time,  official  \"Dale  Carnegie \\n\\nCourse\"  instructors.  By  1920,  Carnegie  had  published  Public \\n\\nSpeaking,  an  official  text  that  he  used  to  launch  Carnegie  courses \\n\\nin  Boston,  Philadelphia,  and  Baltimore. \\n\\nAnd \\n\\nit\\'s  possible  none  of \\n\\nit  would\\'ve  happened  had  not \\n\\nCarnegie  encouraged  his  initial  classes  to  open  up  and  to  share ', 'www.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cThe Art of Small Talk \\n\\n157 \\n\\ntheir stories.  It\\'s  no wonder  Carnegie  never  failed  to  stress  listening \\n\\nas  a  crucial  networking  skill.  In  an  age when  computers and  e-mail \\n\\ntake  the  personal  touch  out  of  doing  business,  Carnegie\\'s  home \\n\\nspun  logic  remains  as  relevant  as  ever.  People,  after  all,  are  still \\n\\npeople,  and  who  couldn\\'t  use  a  reminder  of  lessons  like: \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n\"Become  genuinely  interested  in  other  people.\" \\n\\n\"Be  a  good  listener.  Encourage  others  to  talk  about  themselves.\" \\n\\n\"Let the  other  person  do  a  great  deal  of  the  talking.\" \\n\\n• \\n•  \"Smile.\" \\n• \\n\\n\"Talk  in  terms  of  the  other  person\\'s  interests.\" \\n\\n• \\n\\n\"Give  honest  and  sincere  appreciation.\" \\n\\nThough  he  successfully  applied  the  fundamentals  of  smart  small-', 'talking  to  his  own  life,  Carnegie was  reluctant—at first—to  share  his \\n\\nsecrets  in  book form.  The course cost $75,  and  Carnegie wasn\\'t keen \\n\\non  giving  away  its  content.  But  Leon  Shimkin,  an  editor  at  Simon  & \\n\\nSchuster,  was  a  passionate  graduate  of  Carnegie\\'s  classes.  Shimkin \\n\\nfinally convinced  Carnegie,  to  the  benefit of  us  all,  to write  a  book. \\n\\n\"Perhaps  by  practicing  the  very  sort  of  flattery  and  persistence  that \\n\\nMr.  Carnegie  himself  advocated  and  admired—Mr.  Shimkin  won \\n\\nhim  over,\" wrote  Edwin  McDowell  in  the  New York Times  in  1986. \\n\\nFor  Shimkin,  and  millions  more  like  him,  Carnegie  emboldened \\n\\nus  with  the  belief  that  we  can  learn  to  get  along  better  with  other \\n\\npeople—and  achieve  great  success—no  matter who we  are  or  how ', 'poor  we  were. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cSECTION  THREE \\n\\nTurning  Connections \\ninto  Compatriots \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cC H A P T ER  1  8 \\n\\nHealth, Wealth, and Children \\n\\nWhat do you really want? Side by side, those five words may \\n\\nbe the most universally resonant in the English language. \\nAs  I  discussed  in  the  chapter  \"What\\'s  Your  Mission?\"  the \\nanswer to \"What do you really want?\" determines all that you do \\nand  all  the  people  who  help  you  accomplish  it.  It  provides  the \\nblueprint for all your efforts to reach out and connect with others. \\nLikewise, when you understand someone else\\'s mission, you hold \\nthe key to opening the door to what matters most to them.

Learning to become a  con \\nnector means in some sense learning to become an armchair ther \\napist.  As  you  continue  down  this  path,  you'll  become  a  keen \\nobserver  of the  human  psyche. You'll  have  to  learn  what  makes \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c162 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\npeople  tick and  how best to  satisfy whatever  tick that may be.  It \\nmeans calling something BS when you see people being less than \\nhonest with themselves. \\n\\nThe  most successful  relationship  builders  are,  indeed,  a  nifty \\namalgam  of  financial  guru,  sex  therapist,  and  all-around  do-\\ngooder. \\n\\nConnecting is a philosophy of life, a worldview. Its guiding princi \\nple is that people, all people, every person you meet, is an oppor \", \"on mutual dependence? For starters, because, as a matter of neces \\nsity, we are all social beings. Our strength comes from what we do \\nand  know  cumulatively.  The  fact  is,  no  one  gets  ahead  in  this \\nworld without a lot of help. \\n\\nEliminating things  like  intimidation  and manipulation, there \\nis only one way to get anybody to do anything. Do you know what \\nit is? \\n\\nThis is far from a trivial question. Business is, after all, the abil \\nity to motivate a group of individuals to move an idea from con \\ncept to reality; to take a theory and make it a practice; to gain the \\nbuy-in of your employees  and colleagues; to  encourage others to \\nexecute your plans. \\n\\nIf you're  still  not  sure  what  the  answer  is,  take  heart;  many \\npeople  don't.  There  are  hundreds  of new books  published  each \\nyear  grappling  with  how  to  engender  loyalty  and  motivation. \\nMost arrive at the wrong answer. \\n\\nThey get it wrong because of the assumptions they make. It's in \", \"ferent!  Business has changed!  The answers, people suggest, must \\nbe found in technology or new forms of leadership or funky orga \\nnizational  theories.  But is  there  anything  really new or  different \\nabout people? Not really. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cHealth, Wealth, and Children \\n\\n163 \\n\\nThe principles  of how to  deal with  other people are the  ones \\nDale  Carnegie espoused over sixty years  ago that have proven to \\nbe universal and timeless. \\n\\nThe only way to get people to do anything is to recognize their \\nimportance  and  thereby  make  them  feel  important.  Every  per \\nson's  deepest lifelong  desire  is  to be  significant  and to  be  recog \\nnized. \\n\\nWhat  better way is  there  to  show  appreciation  and  to  lavish \\npraise on others than to take an interest in who they are and what \\ntheir mission is? \\n\\nThere is an added nuance to discovering what matters to peo \\nple. Helping someone accomplish his or her deepest desires is crit \\nical not only to forming a bond with someone but to keeping that \", \"the  modern  age, but  it  remains  the  hallmark of any strong  rela \\ntionship  and a value many companies are working hard to bring \\ninto their day-to-day practices. \\n\\nLoyalty, to me, means staying true to someone (or something, \\nlike a brand or a customer segment) through thick and thin. Loy \\nalty is a marathon rather than a sprint. As any good brand man \\nager knows, you  don't win  customer loyalty quickly.  It has  to be \\nearned. How? \\n\\nLet me tell you a story about Michael Milken: yes, the  financial \\nand deal-making guru but also a man who is a philanthropist and \\ndeeply  insightful  human  behaviorist.  Through  Entertainment \\nMedia Ventures (EMV), Mike was an investor in the start-up com \\npany  I joined  after  Starwood.  And,  during  my  recruitment  as \\nCEO, I made it clear to him and my friend Sandy Climan, who led \\nEMV,  that  a big  motivation  of taking  the job  would be  to  learn \\nfrom  Mike  while  running  the  company.  I  had  already  gotten  to \", 'advisor  to  DuPont, when  the  company was  starting  a  consumer \\nsoy-milk joint venture. Mike was someone I had always wanted to \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c164 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nmeet—one  of  my  early  aspirational  contacts.  I  had  discovered \\nthrough  some  articles  I  had  read  about him  that he  had  a  great \\ndeal  of interest  in  soy  and  its  curative  effects.  He  had  suffered  a \\nbout  with  prostate  cancer,  which  he  turned  into  a  passion  for \\nhealth  care  and  the  importance  of  preventative  medicine.  To \\nMike, diet was an integral component in that mix, and it became \\na personal and philanthropic passion. \\n\\nFrom the beginning of my tenure as CEO, I sought to build the \\ncompany and further my relationship with Mike. He, in turn, took \\nme under his wing and opened his world to me. \\n\\nIf he  was  going  to  New York  for  one  of his  many  CapCure ', \"prostate cancer, or traveling to someplace to give out recognition \\nand  money  to  exceptional  teachers  through  the  Milken  Family \\nFoundation, I would try to catch a ride. My only goal was to watch \\nhow he worked and perhaps glean a few insights in the process. I \\nmade  it  a  point  to  identify  customers  or  prospects  at  whatever \\ndestination city he was going to, so it was time well spent for YaYa \\nas well. \\n\\nMost of the time, we would sit quietly working. He would plow \\nthrough one of the ten bags of reading he lugs with him wherever \\nhe  goes,  and I,  of course, would be  pounding  away on  my com \\nputer,  e-mailing  and  connecting  with  abandon  for YaYa  revenue \\ngeneration  and  business  development.  There  was  much  to  be \\nlearned in  simply watching what he  read and how he thought or \\nreflected. \\n\\nOn  one  trip  in  particular,  Mike  and  I  began  to  talk  about \\npeople's passions, what really mattered to people. It was then that \", 'Mike, in addition to having a brilliant quantitative mind, is also a \\nrelationship  artist. \\n\\nI  have  seen  him  spend  hours  talking  to  people  you\\'d  never \\nexpect him to take an interest in: secretaries, the very old and the \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cHealth, Wealth, and Children \\n\\n165 \\n\\nvery young, the powerful and the powerless. He loves people, their \\nstories, and how they view the world. When I mentioned that to \\nhim,  I was  reminded  of what  Ralph  Waldo  Emerson  once  said: \\n\"Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of \\nhim.\" Everyone had something to teach him. \\n\\nThis focus on people was the reason so many of them showed \\nso  much loyalty to  him.  I  feel  that  same loyalty.  I  asked how so \\nmany people  became  so  invested in their  relationship  with  him. \\nWhat did he know that others didn\\'t? Mike paused for a moment, \\nas he does when he particularly likes (or dislikes) a question. Then \\nhe smiled. \\n\\n\"Keith,\"  he  said,  \"there  are  three  things  in  this  world  that ', 'wealth, and children.\" \\n\\nThere are a lot of things we can do for other people: give good \\nadvice, help them wash their car, or help them move. But health, \\nwealth,  and  children  affect  us  in  ways  other  acts  of  kindness \\ndo not. \\n\\nWhen  you  help  someone  through  a  health  issue,  positively \\nimpact  someone\\'s  personal  wealth,  or  take  a  sincere  interest  in \\ntheir children, you engender life-bonding loyalty. \\n\\nMike\\'s experience was, in fact, backed by research. Psychologist \\nAbraham Maslow created a theory outlining human beings\\' hier \\narchy of needs. We all have the same needs, Maslow believed, and \\nour  more  basic  needs  must  be  satisfied  before  our  higher  needs \\ncan be addressed. \\n\\nThe highest human need, said Maslow, is for self-actualization— \\nthe desire to become the best you can be. Dale Carnegie astutely \\nrecognized this. But Maslow argues we can\\'t attend to our highest \\nneeds until we attend to those at the bottom of the pyramid, like \\nthe  necessities  of subsistence,  security,  and  sex.  It  is  within  this ', 'Mike  was  saying  loyalty  is  created.  In  addressing  those  three \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c166 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nfundamental  issues,  you  accomplish  two  things:  1)  You  help \\nsomeone fulfill those needs they most need met, and 2) You allow \\nthem the opportunity to move up the pyramid of needs to tackle \\nsome of their higher desires. \\n\\nI  reflected on my own experience and found he was absolutely \\n\\nright. \\n\\nRecently, a friend of mine was diagnosed with prostate cancer. \\nBecause of my relationship with the CapCure foundation, I knew \\nthe lead doctor there.  I  gave him  a  call  to  see  if he  could  spend \\nsome time with my friend. Another friend, Mehmet Oz, the wun-\\nderkind  who  directs  the  Cardiovascular  Institute  at  Columbia \\nUniversity and  is  a  founder  and  director  of the  Complementary \\nMedicine  Program  at  NewYork-Presbyterian  Hospital,  is  always \\ntaking the calls of people I send his way. \\n\\nI know intimately how in a time of anxiety a reassuring expert ', 'heart-related  illness,  a  family  friend  named  Arlene  Treskovich, \\nwho worked for one of the best heart doctors  in  Pittsburgh, gave \\nus access to medical advice few blue-collar Pittsburgh families can \\nafford. She was just doing what she was taught; her mother, Marge, \\nhad worked  at  the  Latrobe Hospital  and  used to  make  sure that \\nany member of our family or friends of our family who were hos \\npitalized were treated like royalty, even if it was just an extra Jell-O \\nfrom the kitchen when it was closed. To this day, I would do any \\nthing Arlene asked of me. \\n\\nSometimes, all  it requires  is taking an  interest and providing \\nemotional support. Let me give you an example. Robin Richards \\nwas  the  founding  president  of music  portal  MP3.com  and  built \\none  of the  highest-profile  Internet  companies  in  the  world.  He \\nskillfully  navigated  MP3.com  through  a  very  difficult  period \\nbefore  selling  it  to Vivendi  Universal,  which  subsequently hired ', 'was leading a negotiation to buy our company. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cHealth, Wealth, and Children \\n\\n167 \\n\\nThe  deal  ultimately  fell  through,  but  during  the  process,  I \\nlearned Robin had a young child who had suffered from a terrible \\nform  of cancer.  When  he  shared  this  deeply  painful  and  private \\npiece  of information  over  dinner with  me,  the  dynamics  that  so \\noften attend a negotiation flew out the window.

I never sought him out, but he was somebody I knew would \\nbe very interesting, a hardworking Italian guy who worked his way \\nup from nothing. I figured we had plenty in common. \\n\\nOur first encounter was pure serendipity.  I  attended a lunch \", 'in Los Angeles during President Clinton\\'s last year of office. I spot \\nted Jack among the attendees. When we all sat down for lunch, I \\nmade sure he and I were sitting next to each other. \\n\\nOur  conversation  that  afternoon was  good,  entertaining,  and \\npolite.  I had no  mission  or purpose.  I hoped it might, someday, \\nform the basis for something more substantive. \\n\\nNot long  after,  a  friend  called  me, knowing  I  was  passionate \\nabout  mentoring.  \"You  know,  Jack  Valenti\\'s  son  is  looking  for \\nwork in your industry. You might want to meet with him and give \\nhim some advice.\" \\n\\nJack\\'s son is a very bright chip  off the old block, both charm \\ning and smart. I gave him some advice, introduced him to some \\npeople within the industry that he should know, and that was it. \\n\\nSeveral  months  later,  at the Yale  CEO  conference,  I  saw Jack \\n\\nagain. \\n\\n\"Jack,\"  I  said, \"I\\'m  sure  you  don\\'t  remember  me.

He  peppered  me  with  questions  about  his  son \\nand what the best tack was to enter my industry. \\n\\nI followed up  our encounter a day later with  a  dinner invita \\ntion, along with  an  array of political  and entertainment honchos \\nhe could meet. \\n\\n\"Sure, I\\'d love to come to dinner if my schedule allows,\" he told \\nme. \"But more  important, I\\'d like to  get together for lunch with \\nyou, me, and my son.\" \\n\\nJack  probably wasn\\'t  that  interested  in  my dinner  invitation. \\nWho knows?  But he was interested in the welfare of his son.

Greg  Seal  pulled me  into  his  office  one  day not \\nlong  after  I  had  been  hired  at  Deloitte,  sat  me  down,  and  said, \\n\"Stop driving yourself—and everyone else—crazy thinking about \\nhow to make yourself successful.  Start thinking about how you\\'re \\ngoing to make everyone around you successful.\" \\n\\nFrom the moment I had arrived at Deloitte, I was a man on a \\nmission. I wanted to work more hours, meet more partners, be on \\nthe  biggest  projects  solving the  biggest  problems—and I  wanted \\nto  do  it  all  now,  because  I  was  desperate  to  make  a  name  for \\nmyself. In the wake of my ambition, a whole lot of people didn\\'t \\nlike me. And at Deloitte, as in all organizations, it isn\\'t easy getting \\nthings done when your peers dislike you. \\n\\nThat you\\'d  anger  and  abuse  some  people  on  your way to  the ', 'the secrets to becoming a corporate chieftain, Power!

Think  of it  as  a  game. When  someone \\nmentions a problem, try to think of solutions. The solutions come \\nfrom my experience and knowledge, and my tool kit of friends and \\nassociates. For example, if I\\'m in a conversation and the other per \\nson mentions they\\'re looking to buy a house in Los Angeles, the first \\nthing I think is \"How can my network help?\" And there\\'s no time to \\nlinger.  Mid-conversation,  I\\'ll  pull  out  my  cell  phone  and  locate ', 'I might say something like, \"You need to meet this Realtor I know \\nnamed Betty. No one knows the Los Angeles area better. Here\\'s her \\nphone number, but hold on—\" Now Betty is on the line. \"Hi, Betty, \\nit\\'s so nice to hear your voice. It has been too long. Listen, I\\'m stand \\ning here with a friend who  is in need of your wisdom. I just gave \\nhim your number and wanted to tell you personally he\\'d be calling.\" \\nThe connection is made, the work is done, and whatever happens \\nnext, both parties are pleased by my efforts on their behalf. \\n\\nThis is social arbitrage at work. And the first key is, don\\'t wait \\n\\nto be asked. Just do it. \\n\\nLet  me  give  you  another  example,  an  interaction  I  had  with \\nHank Bernbaum, the  CEO  of High  Sierra, a small bag manufac \\nturer out of Chicago. Hank had seen a short profile on me and my \\nmarketing expertise in the magazine Fast Company. He called me \\nout of the blue and said, \"The article on you was excellent.\" \\n\\nAlready, he had my attention. ', 'ing. We\\'ve  got the  best  duffels  and bags  in America,  but  no  one \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cSocial Arbitrage \\n\\n173 \\n\\nknows  it.  Our  revenue  and  market  size  is  a  quarter  of what  it \\nshould be. Can you help?\" \\n\\nHe added, \"By the way, we don\\'t have a lot of money to burn.\" \\nI usually love taking these calls when time allows, because I\\'m \\nable to play confidante, counselor, or even concierge, for so many \\ndifferent people. I\\'m constantly introducing two  people from dif \\nferent  parts  of  my  life  who  might  benefit  from  knowing  each \\nother. It\\'s a sort of ongoing puzzle, matching up the right people \\nand the right opportunities. Once you, too, start to see the world \\nthis way,  it  opens  up  exciting  opportunities.  It\\'s  both  rewarding \\nand fun. Hank needed some consulting help and his bags needed \\nexposure. I called Peter, a consultant who had worked with me at \\nStarwood Hotels, a terrific marketing guy and someone who loved ', 'head of marketing at Reebok. Their bags never sold as well as their \\nother products, and I thought the two might benefit from sharing \\ninsights  and experiences.  I even \"cloned\" a meeting I had with a \\nmarketing executive at Reebok, and brought Hank along to make \\nface-to-face  introductions. \\n\\nThen I asked Hank if he\\'d ever had any publicity. He hadn\\'t. I \\nsent  a couple  of Hank\\'s  totes to Alan Webber, the  editor of Fast \\nCompany. A few months later, the magazine did a piece on High \\nSierra products  after Alan had his writers  evaluate  a particularly \\ninnovative travel bag we had sent. \\n\\nHank was  ecstatic.  But then I  added one more thing: \"Hank, \\nthe calls I\\'m making on your behalf, you need to be doing this for \\nyourself. Do you belong to the Executive Club in Chicago?\" \\n\\n\"I\\'ve been thinking about it,\" he said. \"Why?\" \\n\"You\\'ve got to  stop  thinking of yourself and your company as \\nan island. You need to meet people. There are a lot of CEOs and \\nsmart people in the Executive Club who  could\\'ve done what I\\'m ', 'connections.\" \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c174 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nSoon after, Hank started networking locally with other execu \\ntives.  Hank\\'s  products  are  superb;  what  he  needed was  the  net \\nwork.  However,  it\\'s  not just  he  and  I  who  have  prospered.  My \\nformer  colleague,  Peter,  the  outdoorsy marketer  from  Starwood, \\nused  the  experience  to  build  the  confidence  he  needed  to  ulti \\nmately go out on his own. He now has a thriving consulting  firm \\nin New York. The CMO  at Reebok? He was grateful for an intro \\nduction that might help him boost his bag business. What started \\nwith  one  man  and  a  problem,  ended  with  several  people  and \\nmany solutions. \\n\\nMy point? Real power comes from being indispensable. Indis-\\npensability  comes  from  being  a  switchboard,  parceling  out  as \\nmuch information, contacts, and goodwill to as many people—in \\nas many different worlds—as possible ', \"It's  a sort of career karma. How much you  give to the  people \\nyou  come  into  contact with  determines  how much you'll  receive \\nin  return.  In  other  words,  if you  want  to  make  friends  and  get \\nthings  done, you  have  to  put yourself out to  do  things  for  other \\npeople—things that require time, energy, and consideration. \\n\\nSuccessfully connecting with others is never about simply get \\nting what you want. It's about getting what you want and making \\nsure  that  people  who  are  important  to  you  get  what  they want \\nfirst.  Often,  that  means  fixing  up  people  who  would  otherwise \\nnever have an opportunity to meet. \\n\\nThe  best  sort  of  connecting  occurs  when  you  can  bring \\ntogether two  people  from  entirely different worlds.  The  strength \\nof your network derives  as much from the  diversity of your rela \\ntionships as it does from their quality or quantity. \\n\\nMost of us know the people within  our own professional  and \", 'your own, I would urge you to make a point of knowing as many \\npeople  from  as  many  different  professions  and  social  groups  as \\npossible. The ability to bridge different worlds, and even different \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cSocial Arbitrage \\n\\n175 \\n\\npeople within the same profession, is a key attribute in managers \\nwho are paid better and promoted faster, according to an influen \\ntial study conducted by Ron Burt, a professor at the University of \\nChicago Graduate School of Business. \\n\\n\"People who have contacts in separate groups have a competi \\ntive advantage because we live in a system  of bureaucracies, and \\nbureaucracies create walls,\" says Burt. \"Individual managers with \\nentrepreneurial  networks  move  information  faster,  are  highly \\nmobile  relative  to  bureaucracy,  and  create  solutions  better \\nadapted to the needs of the organization.\" \\n\\nHis  research  goes  a  long  way  toward  answering  that  persis \\ntently nagging  question:  Is  it what you know  or who  you know \\nthat  leads  to  success?  For  Burt,  it\\'s  both. Who  you  know  deter ', \"things done, and climbing the walls of your company, require hav \\ning the right relationships. \\n\\nI've  always  been well  aware  of this  idea. At Deloitte,  I  got to \\nknow  the  CMOs  of  our  largest  competition.  At  Starwood,  I \\nquickly  became  familiar  with  the  industry  influencers.  When  I \\nbecame CEO of YaYa, I set out to meet the leadership in the media \\nand  computer  games  industry. What  I  didn't  realize was  that  all \\nalong  I  was  setting  the  groundwork for  the  success  of Ferrazzi-\\nGreenlight at the same time. No matter what the job, if I was going \\nto push my company's product into an important brand position \\namong those who mattered, I needed to be able to  converse with \\nthe  players  inside  and  outside  the  industry who  could  help  me \\nmake that happen. One of the ways I achieved this was by helping \\nthem get to know one another—which they, too, knew was benefi \\ncial for their business. I was surprised, for instance, that the heads \", 'Maybe you\\'re thinking to yourself, \"But I don\\'t know any exec \\nutives or key people in my industry!

Performing social arbi-\\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c176 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\ntrage when your financial and relational resources are thin is actu \\nally not too big  a hurdle.  The  solution is knowledge, one  of the \\nmost valuable currencies in social arbitrage. Knowledge is free—it \\ncan  be  found  in  books, in  articles,  on  the  Internet,  pretty much \\neverywhere, and it\\'s precious to everyone. \\n\\nThe ability to distribute knowledge in a network is a fairly easy \\nskill to learn. So easy, in fact, you should get started today. Identify \\nsome  of the  leading  thinkers  and  writers  in  your  industry.  Do \\nthese figures have  any new books  on the market?  Look at what\\'s \\nhot on the nonfiction New York Times bestseller list. Or for busi \\nness bestsellers, check out the Wall Street Journal\\'s list in the Per \\nsonal  Journal  section  on  Friday.  Buy the book,  read  it,  and  take ', 'ies or anecdotes, and why it\\'s relevant to the people you\\'re think \\ning about passing your knowledge on to. You\\'ve just created your \\nown Big  Idea of the  Month  Cliffs Notes  (or whatever snazzy title \\nyou choose). Now pick a few people, some whom you know well \\nand some you don\\'t, and e-mail them your work. All you have to \\nsay is \"Here are some cool ideas I think you\\'d like to be on top of.\" \\n\\nPresto! You\\'re now a knowledge broker. After you get the swing \\nof it, you might want to send out a monthly Big Idea Cliffs Notes \\ne-mail. Turn it into a newsletter. If one month you don\\'t have the \\ntime,  you  could  forward  some  particularly  helpful  article  you \\nread. Or, if the book is particularly interesting and you really want \\nto make an impression, send the book itself. \\n\\nIt\\'s  easy  enough  to  make  knowledge  brokering  a  habit.  Let\\'s \\nsay, for instance, someone mentions over lunch or in the minutes \\nbefore the start of a meeting that they are having a hard time deal \\ning  with  their  teenage  son  or  daughter. You  should  hear \"prob ', 'a solution.\" If you don\\'t have any personal advice, the solution will \\ncome from asking yourself, \"How can my network of friends  and \\ncontacts help? Which one of my friends has teenagers?\" It proba-\\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cSocial Arbitrage \\n\\n177 \\n\\nbly won\\'t take long before you come up with someone you know, \\nmaybe your own parents, who handled their own teenage kids in \\na  constructive  manner.  Get  on  the  phone  and  ask  them  if they \\nhave any advice, or if they used any books or articles to help them \\nthrough the process. Now pass it on. \\n\\nOr  let\\'s  say you\\'re  a  real  estate  agent but you  aspire  to  be  a \\nclothing  designer.  I  don\\'t  know  too  much  about  clothes,  but  as \\nwith just about any subject, I\\'m sure others do  (one of those peo \\nple has almost certainly written a book about it). Do a search on \\nAmazon.com, and find something that seems helpful to someone \\nlooking  to  become  a  clothing  designer.  Then  send  the  aspiring ', 'conversation—that would be real value. \\n\\nYes, this kind of reaching out takes time and a certain thoughtful-\\nness. But that is exactly why it\\'s so appreciated. Facilitating all those \\nconnections, all that knowledge, and ultimately all that happiness \\nis what being a truly modern-day \"power broker\" is all about. \\n\\nTo  paraphrase  Dale  Carnegie: You  can be  more  successful  in \\ntwo  months by becoming really interested in  other people\\'s  suc \\ncess than you can in two years trying to get other people interested \\nin your own success. \\n\\nCONNECTORS\\'  HALL  OF  FAME  PROFILE \\n\\nV e r n on  Jordan \\n\\n\"Make yourself indispensable to others.\" \\n\\nVernon  Jordan,  dealmaker  extraordinaire,  former  Clinton  advisor, \\n\\nand  Washington  super-lawyer,  currently  sits  on \\n\\nten  corporate \\n\\nboards, \\n\\nincluding  American  Express,  Dow  Jones,  Revlon,  and \\n\\nXerox.

He's  connected  Lou  Gerstner \\n\\nwith  IBM.  He  approached  Colin  Powell  about  replacing  Warren \\n\\nChristopher  as  Secretary  of  State.  He  helped  James  Wolfensohn \\n\\nbecome  President  of  the  World  Bank. \\n\\nHow  has  he  done  it? \\n\\nJordan  has  used  social  arbitrage  to  make  himself  indispensa \\n\\nble—he  is,  in  every sense of the word,  a  modern-day power  broker. \\n\\nBut  he  wasn't  always  at  the  vortex  of  everything  that  happens  in \", 'Washington.  He  didn\\'t  even  live  full-time  in  Washington  until  Akin \\n\\nGump  hired  him  in  1982.

Akin  Gump  knew  it too,  which  is \\n\\none  reason  they  hired  him:  \"I  knew  he  would  fit  into  the  Washing \\n\\nton  legal  community  and  come  to  be  a  dominant  figure  in  it,\"  said \\n\\nRobert  Strauss,  a  senior  partner.  \"This  is  a  town  built  on  the  use  of \\n\\npower and  on  relationships,  and  Vernon  is  about as  good  a  people \\n\\nperson  as  I  know.\" \\n\\nJordan  became a  household  name to all Americans  in the  1 990s ', \"because  of  his  relationship  with  Bill  Clinton.

His  role  was  to  find  volunteers \\n\\nwho  could  organize  voter  drives,  and  to  raise  money  for  the  proj \\n\\nect.  Raising  money  compelled  Jordan  to  travel  throughout  the \\n\\nSouth,  pitching  wealthy  foundations  on  why  they  should  grant \\n\\nmoney  to  the  VEP.  It  was  this  position  that  allowed  Jordan  to  gain \", \"respect  as  a  man  who  could  fight  for  the  cause  from  within  the \\n\\nestablishment.  His  Rolodex  began  to  expand  as  he  forged  connec \\n\\ntions with  both  the  heads  of foundations  and  the VEP  supervisors  in \\n\\nWashington,  D.C. \\n\\nJordan  first  ingratiated  himself  to  the  Fortune  5 00  community \\n\\nwhen,  in  1966,  he was  invited  to  President Johnson's  White  House \\n\\nconference  on  civil  rights,  which  was  attended  by  hundreds  of \\n\\nCEOs.  For  the  remainder  of  the  '60s  and  '70s,  he  traveled  as  a \\n\\nplugged-in  member  of  both  corporate  and  civil  rights  circles.  His \\n\\ninvolvement  in  one  circle  made  him  all  the  more  valuable  to  the \\n\\nother.  Favors  done  and  friends  made  in  one  circle  could  be  lever \", 'aged  to  do  favors  and  make  friends  in  the  other. \\n\\nJordan\\'s  full-time  jobs  allowed  him  to  keep  one  foot  in  each \\n\\nworld.

She  revealed  what  many young \\nblack  and white  professionals  had  long  known  privately:  Jordan \\nhad  been  opening  doors  for  people  of  all  colors  and  creeds  for \\ndecades. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cC H A P T ER \\n\\n20 \\n\\nPinging—All the Time \\n\\nIf 80 percent of success is, as Woody Allen once said, just show \\n\\ning up, then 80  percent of building and maintaining relation \", 'ships is just staying in touch. \\n\\nI  call  it  \"pinging.\"  It\\'s  a  quick,  casual  greeting,  and  it  can \\nbe  done  in  any  number  of  creative  ways.  Once  you  develop \\nyour  own  style,  you\\'ll  find  it  easier  to  stay  in  touch  with  more \\npeople than you ever dreamed of in less time than you ever imag \\nined. \\n\\nYes,  there\\'s  grunt  work  involved.  Pinging  takes  effort.  That\\'s \\nthe tough part. You have to keep pinging and pinging and pinging \\nand never stop. You have to feed the fire of your network or it will \\nwither or die. \\n\\nHow many times have you asked yourself, \"What\\'s his face . .. \\nYa know, that guy ...\" Or \"I know her, I just can\\'t remember her \\nname  .  .  .\" We  all  face  that  situation  all  too  often,  to  my mind. \\nEvery time I hear those statements uttered, I  sense a network or \\ncommunity of contacts withering. ', \"These days we're overwhelmed with so much information that \\nour minds can prioritize only the most recent data. What does it \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c182 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\ntake  to  break  through  the  white  noise  of information  overload? \\nBecoming front and center in someone's mental  Rolodex is  con \\ntingent on one invaluable little concept: repetition. \\n\\n•  People you're  contacting to  create  a new relationship  need to \\nsee  or  hear  your  name  in  at  least  three  modes  of  commu \\nnication—by,  say,  an  e-mail,  a  phone  call,  and  a  face-to-face \\nencounter—before there is substantive recognition. \\n\\n•  Once  you  have  gained  some  early  recognition,  you  need  to \\nnurture a developing relationship with a phone call or e-mail \\nat least once a month. \\n\\n•  If you  want to  transform  a  contact into  a friend, you need  a \\n\\nminimum  of two  face-to-face meetings  out of the  office. \", \"•  Maintaining  a  secondary  relationship  requires  two  to  three \\n\\npings a year. \\n\\nUsing  the  above  rules  of thumb  should  give  you  an  idea  of \\nwhat it'll take to keep your own network humming. I make hun \\ndreds  of phone calls a day. Most of them are simply quick hellos \\nthat I leave on a friend's voice mail. I also send e-mail constantly. \\nUsing a BlackBerry, I've found I can do the majority of my ping \\ning while in trains, planes, and automobiles.  I  remember—or at \\nleast  my  PDA  remembers—personal  events  like  birthdays  and \\nanniversaries, and I make a special point of reaching out to people \\nduring these times. \\n\\nWhen it comes to relationship maintenance, you have to be on \\n\\nyour game 24/7, 365 days a year. \\n\\nThere's no doubt you have to bring a certain vigor to this part \\nof the system. But hey, this is just my way of doing things. You'll \\nfigure  out your own way. The governing principle here is repeti-\\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cPinging—All the Time \", '183 \\n\\ntion;  find  a  way  to  ensure  that  you\\'ll  contact  people  regularly \\nwithout putting too much strain on your schedule. \\n\\nOne  way  I\\'ve  found  to  make  maintaining  my  network  of \\ncontacts,  colleagues,  and  friends  easier  is  to  create  a  rating  sys \\ntem  for  the  network that  corresponds  to  how  often  I  reach  out. \\nFirst,  I  divide  my  network  into  five  general  categories:  Under \\n\"Personal,\"  I  include  my good  friends  and  social  acquaintances. \\nBecause  I\\'m  generally  in  contact  with  these  people  organically, \\nI  don\\'t include them  on  a contact list. The relationship  is  estab \\nlished, and when we talk, it\\'s  as if we\\'d been  in touch  every day. \\n\"Customers\"  and  \"Prospects\"  are  self-explanatory.  \"Important \\nBusiness  Associates\"  is  reserved  for  people  I\\'m  actively involved \\nwith professionally. I\\'m either doing business with them currently ', 'category.  Under \"Aspirational  Contacts,\"  I  list  people  I\\'d  like  to \\nget to know, or I\\'ve met briefly (which is anyone from your boss\\'s \\nboss  to  a  worthy  celebrity)  and  would  like  to  establish  a  better \\nrelationship with. \\n\\nAfter  reading  the  chapter  on  taking  names,  you\\'ve  probably \\nalready begun  to  segment  and  categorize your network in  a way \\nthat works  for you—there  is  no  standard method here.  Create  a \\nsegmentation  that  works  for  you  and  your  objectives.  This  is  a \\ngood habit and one that deserves  repeating. All  successful  people \\nare planners. They think on paper. Failing to plan, as they say, is \\nplanning to fail. And a plan is a list of activities and names. \\n\\nThe next step  is to  print out your master list of contacts that \\ncontains  all  the  people  in  your  network  under  the  categories \\nyou\\'ve  placed  them  in.  The  question  now  is  How  often  do  you ', 'there\\'s no reason you can\\'t improve upon it. I\\'ll go down my mas \\nter list and add the numbers  1, 2, or 3 next to each name. \\n\\nA  \" 1\"  gets  contacted  at  least  each  month.  This  means  I\\'m \\nactively involved with  the  person, whether  it\\'s  a friend  or  a new \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c184 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nbusiness associate. With new relationships, a \" 1\" generally means I \\nhave  yet  to  solidify  the  relationship  with  at  least  three  different \\nforms of communication. Each time I reach out to a person, I like \\nto include a very short note next to their name telling me the last \\ntime I contacted them and how. If last month I sent an e-mail say \\ning hello to a potential customer rated \"1,\" this month I\\'ll give a \\ncall. Also, contacts designated \" 1\" I add to my cell phone\\'s speed \\ndial. (How I love thee, speed dial, let me count the ways! It allows \\nme quick reference and an easy way to get in touch fast.) If I have ', 'several  calls  to  keep  in  touch  with  people  I\\'ve  not  spoken  to \\nrecently. \\n\\nA \"2\" rating indicates my \"touch base\" people. These are either \\ncasual  acquaintances  or people whom  I  already know well. They \\nget a quarterly call or e-mail. I try to include these people in mass \\ne-mails about my business. And like the rest of my network, they \\nget either an annual holiday card or birthday call. \\n\\nThose  people  rated  \"3\"  are  people  I  don\\'t  know  well,  who, \\nbecause of time  and circumstance, I\\'m unable to  devote any sig \\nnificant  energy  to  pinging.  These  people  are  strictly  acquain \\ntances, people I\\'ve met in passing, but who have found their way \\ninto  my address  book.  I  hope to  reach  this  group, in  some way, \\nat least  once  a year.  The  surprising  thing  about this  category is \\nthat,  because you  don\\'t know the  person  all  that well when you ', 'Most  people  are  delighted,  and  their  curiosity  piqued,  when \\nsomeone they don\\'t know all that well sends them a note, however \\nshort. \\n\\nThe third step, as I mentioned in the chapter on taking names, \\nis segmenting your network into call lists. In time, your master list \\nwill become too unwieldy to work from directly. Your call lists will \\nsave you time and keep your efforts focused. They can be organ \\nized  by your  number  ratings,  by geography,  by industry,  and  so \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cPinging—All the Time \\n\\n185 \\n\\non. It\\'s totally flexible. If I\\'m flying to New York, for example, I\\'ll \\nprint out a \"New York list\" and make a few calls to my \"Is\" when I \\ngot off the plane. \"Hi, Jan. Just landed in New York and it made me \\nthink of you. No time to meet this trip, but I just wanted to touch \\nbase.\"  This  New  York  list  also  proves  very  helpful  a  week  in \\nadvance  of the  trip  in  trying to fill in those  extra slots  of time I ', \"\\nWhere do I find the time? Again, you find time everywhere. I \\nping in the cab, or in my car. I ping in the bathroom (BlackBerry \\nonly).  When  I'm  bored  at  a  conference,  I  ping  via  e-mail.  I've \\ndeveloped  the  habit  of saving  every e-mail  I  send  and  receive.  I \\nput  each  e-mail, when  I  receive  it,  in  one  of my categories,  and \\nOutlook records whether I've returned the  e-mail  or not. Then I \\njust open up those files and respond, pinging away. I make a habit \\nof  reviewing  my  master  list  at  the  end  of  the  week  and  cross \\nchecking  it with the  activities  and travel  plans  I have for the fol \\nlowing week. In this way, I stay up-to-date and have my trusty lists \\nat my side all week long. \\n\\nAnother  time-saver  is  to  pay  close  attention  when  you  place \\nyour phone calls. There are times, amusingly enough, when I call in \", \"in-depth conversation; you just want to drop a line and say hello. I \\ntry and take mental notes of people's phone habits if I want to sim \\nply leave a message, I'll call when I know they're not around. Call \\ning their office really early or late usually does the trick. \\n\\nThe important thing  is  that you build the  concept of pinging \\ninto your workflow. Some organizations go so far as to make ping \\ning  integral  to  their  organizational  processes.  I'm  told  that  the \\nconsulting  firm  McKinsey  and  Company  actually  has  a  rule  of \\nthumb that one hundred days after a new CEO takes charge of a \\ncompany,  McKinsey assigns  one  of their  consultants  to  call  and \\nsee  how McKinsey might  help.  One  hundred  days  is,  McKinsey \\nfigures,  just enough  time for the new CEO  to feel that he  or she \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c186 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nknows what the issues and problems are, but not enough time to \\nhave gotten his or her arms around the solutions. \", 'With  pinging  gaining  credibility  as  an  important  business \\npractice,  it  shouldn\\'t surprise you that some  ingenious new soft \\nware has been developed to make it easier. Plaxo is a neat new pro \\ngram,  which  I  mentioned  briefly  in  the  chapter  on  technology, \\nthat  I\\'ve  found  really  helpful.  The  software  this  company  has \\ndeveloped  keeps  people  connected  by  solving  the  common  but \\nfrustrating problem of out-of-date contact information. The soft \\nware goes into your database of contacts, pulls out everybody with \\nan  e-mail  address,  sends  the  record  that you  have  of them,  and \\nasks  them  to  update  it.  When  they  do  so,  it  sends  you  back  an \\ne-mail stating their new information. Automated pinging! \\n\\nI do it every six months or so and have become a true devotee. \\nNot long ago, I did a Plaxo update. A few days later, I got an e-mail \\nfrom  a  former  prospect  I\\'d  lost  contact  with  who  wrote,  \"We ', 'to talk.\" The e-mail turned into a two-million-dollar account. \\n\\nThe medium and message of a ping runs the gamut. There is \\nthe \"I just called to say I care\" ping that I use for closer contacts. \\nEssentially,  I  want to  convey the  message, \"Hey,  it has  been  too \\nlong since we\\'ve spoken and I wanted you to know that I miss you, \\nthat you are important to me.\" And then there are the more pro \\nfessional versions  of the  above.  But always try to  make  any mes \\nsage as personal as possible. \\n\\nFor people important to my career or business, I tend to favor \\nthe value-add ping. Here I\\'m trying to provide something of value \\nin my communication, recognizing when someone I know gets a \\npromotion,  or the  company he or she  runs has  a good  financial \\nquarter, or he or she has a child. I also like to send relevant articles, \\nshort notes of advice, or other small tokens that convey that I am \\nthinking of them and am eager to help. \\n\\nGet  creative.  I  have  one  friend  who  carries  a  digital  camera ', 'www.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cPinging—All the Time \\n\\n187 \\n\\nwherever he  goes. When  he  returns  from  a  conference  or work-\\nrelated travels, he pings the people he met with a quick hello and \\na  picture  attached.  It\\'s  a great idea that has worked very well for \\nhim. I\\'ve got another friend who uses music in a similar manner. \\nWhen  he  meets  someone  new,  he  asks  the  person  what kind  of \\nmusic  he  or  she  enjoys.  This  guy  has  a  growing  digital  music \\nlibrary that\\'s  off the  charts,  and he\\'s  always  on  top  of the  latest \\ngrooves. When he pings, he might write, \"It was a pleasure meet \\ning you the other day. You mentioned your love of jazz. It just so \\nhappens  that  I  have  a  rare  recording  of Miles  Davis.  I  thought \\nyou\\'d get a kick out of it.

Why? \\n\\nBecause  it\\'s  hard  to  differentiate yourself from  the  other  150  people \\n\\ndoing  the  same  thing. \\n\\nMy  personal  favorite  pinging  occasion  remains  birthdays,  the \\n\\nneglected  stepchild  of  life\\'s  celebrated  moments.  As  you  get \\n\\nolder,  the  people  around  you  start  forgetting  your  big  day  (mostly \\n\\nbecause  they  think  they  want  to  forget  their  own).

When  I  met  Kent  that  day,  and  I \\n\\nreceived  his  contact  information,  I  asked  for  his  birth  date,  as  I  try \\n\\nto  do  with  everyone.  It\\'s  not  intrusive,  and  most  people  forget  the \\n\\nmoment  after  they  tell  me. \\n\\nKent  was  a  Mormon.  Born  in  Salt  Lake  City,  Utah,  he  had \\n\\nupward  of ten  brothers  and  sisters.  With  such  a  large  family,  you\\'d ', 'think  the  man\\'s  phone  would  be  ringing  off  the  hook  on  his \\nbirthday. \\n\\nI  hadn\\'t spoken  to  him  for  over  a  year.  It was  a  busy day for  me, \\n\\nand  I  didn\\'t see  the  reminder  until  close  to  3:00  P.M.  that afternoon. \\n\\nGenerally,  I  like  to  make  birthday  calls  in  the  early  morning.  This \\n\\nway  I  get  someone\\'s  voice  mail,  and  when  they  come  in  to  work \\n\\nthat  morning,  they\\'re  greeted  with  my  rendition  of  \"Happy  Birth \\n\\nday.\"  I  can\\'t tell  you  how  many  New York City cabdrivers  must think \\n\\nI\\'m  an  utter  lunatic. \\n\\nSo  when  Kent  actually  picked  up  his  phone  that  afternoon,  my \\n\\npersonal  Pavarotti  of  \"Happy  Birthday\"  greeted  him.  No  greetings. \\n\\nNo  niceties.  I  just let  it  rip.

It\\'s  your \\n\\nbirthday,  right?\"  Nothing.  Not a word.  I  thought I\\'d  made a  jerk out \\n\\nof  myself  and  missed  the  day  or  something. \\n\\n\"Kent?\" \\n\\nFinally  he  stammers  out,  \"Yeah.\"  He  was  choked  up,  audibly \\n\\nholding  back  tears. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cPinging—All the Time \\n\\n189 \\n\\n\"You  all  right?\" \\n\\n\"You  remembered  my  birthday?\"  he  said.

Minimal, yes. A bit grungy, definitely. \\nStill, it never stopped me from throwing outrageously fun dinner \\nparties where I  enjoyed the company of good friends—and a few \\nstrangers. \\n\\nIt  was  in  those  days  that  I  learned  how  powerful  the  art  of \\nthrowing dinner parties could be in creating wonderful memories \\nand strengthening relationships in the process. Today I can safely \\nsay my strongest links have been forged at the table. The compan \\nionable effects of breaking bread—not to mention drinking a few \\nglasses of wine—bring people together. \\n\\nIn those early years, my 400-square-foot, one-bedroom apart \\nment  opposite  the  football field, with  a  kitchen  table  that  could \\nbarely seat two  adults, held wild get-togethers  for four,  six,  even \", \"students,  Boston  locals,  and,  sometimes,  a  person  I  met  in  line \\nwhile checking out groceries. I never thought twice about some of \\nthe minor  inconveniences  those  impoverished  days  bestowed on \\nmy events, like forcing my guests to eat with plates in their laps. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cFind Anchor Tenants and Feed Them \\n\\n191 \\n\\nFor  all  the  sheer  delight  and  good  times  a  dinner  party  can \\nimpart,  it  seems  our  fast-food  culture  has  diminished  our  cen \\nturies-old belief in the power of a shared meal in your own home \\nto  comfort,  nurture,  and  connect people.  Some  people  seem  to \\nthink it's too hard, too time-consuming. The only image they have \\nof  a  dinner  party  is  of  those  grandly  ornate  occasions  once \\nglamorized by Martha Stewart, a friend by the way.  Maybe those \\nfemale-hosted TV shows  are, perhaps,  another reason why men, \\nin particular, have forgotten the virtues of hosting a simple dinner \", \"serve  a  fine  meal  in  your  home  and  still  be  masculine—and,  if \\nyou're single, it will do a world of good for your dating lives. \\n\\nNearly once a month  an  array of different people from  differ \\nent worlds  gathers  at  my home  in  Los  Angeles  or hotel  suite  in \\nNew York  or  a  friend's  home  in  San  Francisco  to  have  fun,  talk \\nbusiness, and meet new people. But I learned the art of throwing \\nthese events back in my dingy Cambridge apartment. \\n\\nBefore  my dinner  parties  had  any cachet,  I  had  to  develop  a \\ndeliberate strategy for attracting a good mix of people that would \\nexpand my social horizons  and get a reputation that would keep \\npeople coming back. \\n\\nYou, me, every one of us—we have an established peer set. But \\nif you only have dinner parties with the same people, your circle \\nof relationships  will  never  grow.  At  the  same  time,  we're  con \\nfronted with a small obstacle. Randomly inviting strangers, espe \", 'your own  peer set, is rarely effective. These people want to  hang \\naround  people  of  their  own  background,  experience,  or  social \\nstatus. \\n\\nParents  tend  to  stay  away  from  their  children\\'s  gatherings \\nunless they expect other parents to be in attendance as well. In col \\nlege,  juniors  and  seniors  avoid  the  parties  populated  solely  by \\nfreshmen and sophomores. In the adult world, it\\'s no different. Go \\nto  any  cafeteria  at  any  major  corporation  in  the  country.  You\\'ll \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c192 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\ngenerally find each strata of the organization—from the adminis \\ntrative  staff  on  up  to  the  executive  suite—congregating  in  their \\nown cliques to eat their lunches. \\n\\nTo overcome this herd mentality and pull people into my din \\nner parties that would otherwise not come, I developed a helpful \\nlittle concept I call the \"anchor tenant.\" \\n\\nEvery  individual  within  a  particular  peer  set  has  a  bridge  to ', \"some degree or another, developed relationships with older, wiser, \\nmore experienced people; they may be our mentors, our parents' \\nfriends, our teachers, our rabbis and reverends, our bosses. \\n\\nI call them anchor tenants; their value comes from the simple \\nfact that they are, in relation to one's core group of friends, differ \\nent.  They  know  different  people,  have  experienced  different \\nthings, and thus, have much to teach. \\n\\nIdentifying and inviting an anchor tenant to your dinner party \\nisn't  hard.  Someone  you  know  probably has  access  and  is  close \\nenough  to  such  an  individual  that  an  invitation  will  be  well \\nreceived. You'll discover who these people are by paying attention \\nto your friends' stories and taking notice of the one or two names \\nthat continually pop up. They tend to be the names of people who \\nhave had a positive influence on your friends' lives. And it stands \\nto reason that they can have the same effect on you. \\n\\nOnce you've identified a person outside your social circle and \\nsuccessfully invited him  or her to  a  dinner, here's  an  added little \", \"about  entertaining  your  dinner-party  regulars.  They'll  come  no \\nmatter what. But an anchor allows you to reach out beyond your \\ncircle in subsequent invitations and pull in people who wouldn't \\notherwise attend. To put it in terms of the company cafeteria, now \\nthat you have the CEO eating lunch at the manager's table, other \\nexecutives will jump at the opportunity to eat at the table, too. \\n\\nFrankly, anyone who can add a little electricity to your dinner \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cFind Anchor Tenants and Feed Them \\n\\n193 \\n\\nparty  is  an  anchor  tenant.  Journalists,  I've  found,  are  terrific \\nanchor  guests.  They  aren't  particularly well  paid  (which  makes \\nthem a sucker for a free meal), their profession has a good deal of \\nintrigue, they are always on the lookout for good material and see \\nsuch dinners as a potential venue for new ideas, they're generally \\ngood conversationalists, and many folks  enjoy an  opportunity to \\nget their ideas heard by someone who might publicize them to a \\nlarger  audience.  Artists  and  actors,  famous  or  not,  fall  into  the \", 'fish  as you might have liked, you can try to pull in a person with \\nproximity to power: a political consultant to an interesting politi \\ncian,  the  COO  of  an  interesting  company  under  an  interesting \\nCEO, and so on. In these cases, it\\'s about brand association. \\n\\nOnce you\\'ve landed an anchor tenant, finding the right mix of \\npeople is critical. For me, the invitation list needs to be a mix of \\nprofessional  folks  I  want  to  do  business  with  today,  contacts  I \\naspire to  do business with  down the road,  and those  I  call \"light \\nattractors\"—guests who  are  energetic, interesting, and willing to \\nspeak their mind. Of course, a local celebrity or two never hurts. \\nAnd it goes without saying that you should have your friends and \\nfamily present, as well. \\n\\nPolitical  columnist Arianna  Huffington  is  one  of my favorite \\ndinner guests. She\\'s gracious, fun, and always outspoken. How did \\nI  land  her?  Through  an  intro  from  my friend  Elana  Weiss,  who ', \"was a big admirer and that I threw these very fun dinner parties in \\nLos Angeles and she'd undoubtedly make them better. She showed \\nup  only for cocktails  at first, had a great time, and has become a \\nregular and a dear friend. \\n\\nWhile  these  kinds  of  dinners  can  often  cinch  an  important \\nbusiness deal, be careful not to include too many business associ \\nates on the invite list or business agendas in the discussion. Talk \\ning about budgets  and other management mumbo jumbo  all the \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c194 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\ntime will ensure a dull  evening.  These events  are about building \\nrelationships. \\n\\nSix to ten guests, I've found, is the optimal number to invite to \\na  dinner.  I  usually  invite  fourteen  now,  but  that's  after  a  lot  of \\npractice. I also invite an extra six or so people to pop in before or \\ncome  after  for  drinks  and  dessert.  This  group  should  be  closer \\nfriends  who  won't  get  offended  for  not  being  at  the  main  event \", 'when you invite  someone  to  dinner, you  get  a  20  to  30  percent \\nacceptance rate because of scheduling difficulties. When someone \\nsays they cannot come because of another dinner or engagement, \\nI  often suggest they come before the dinner for drinks  and appe \\ntizers, or even after, for dessert and drinks. \\n\\nThese \"bonus guests\" will arrive a little before dinner has con \\ncluded. I\\'ll have folding chairs at the ready so they can pull up next \\nto  the  dinner  table,  have  dessert,  and  chat with  the  guests.  Just \\nwhen most dinner parties tend to slip and people begin to look at \\ntheir watches thinking about what time they have to get up in the \\nmorning, the  energy level  spikes with  a whole  new group.  Sud \\ndenly, the dinner turns raucous again. \\n\\nAt about this time, the music that\\'s been playing on the stereo \\ngives way to  a live piano  player. I  don\\'t announce this. From the \\ndining room  or deck where  I  serve  dinner, guests  slowly pick up \\non  the  fact  that  the  music  coming  from  the  living  room  has ', \"invite  a  bunch  of young vocalists  to  come  show off,  or  do  a  bit \\nmore  research  and  find  out  if there  are  some  local  alumni  who \\nused  to  be  part  of Yale's  renowned  singing  group,  the  Whiffen-\\npoofs. For a reasonable fee, the kids are happy to belt out a few old \\ntunes for an old alumnus. \\n\\nAs  dessert  is  being  served, the  Poofs  start singing. The  after-\\nparty guests  arrive, and now the night is  swinging. Some people \\nstay at the table, while others  adjourn to the living room to  sing \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cFind Anchor Tenants and Feed Them \\n\\n195 \\n\\nalong and hang out. The next thing I know, it's one or two in the \\nmorning and I'm closing down another successful event. \\n\\nIf you like to eat and you enjoy the company of others, you can \\npull off your own version of a dinner party that will work beauti \\nfully whatever the setting. \\n\\nMy  friend  Jim  Brehm  is  one  of  the  most  elegant  designers \", \"where  he  used  to  host  a  party  every  other  Thursday.  By  the \\nway,  Thursdays  are wonderful  days  for  dinner  parties.  It  doesn't \\ncut  into  people's  weekend  plans  and  yet  folks  are  willing  to  go \\na little late knowing that they have only one day left in the work \\nweek. \\n\\nI  marveled  at  Jim's  ability  to  make  simplicity  so  elegant.  I \\nfound the same quality in Jim's architecture and designs. His stu \\ndio had a long bench  covered in velvet along one wall  and a few \\nblack leather cubes to sit on. We'd be served champagne. Light jazz \\nmusic would play in the background. The dinner guests tended to \\nbe a fascinating mix of artists and writers and musicians. \\n\\nTo eat, we'd walk five steps to a small simple wooden table with \\nno  tablecloth,  adorned  with  two  silver  candles.  The  chairs  were \\nfold-out. Each plate had a big bowl of homemade chili on it and a \\ntorn-off piece of fresh bread. For dessert, he would serve ice cream \", 'Anyone  can  throw  a  dinner  party.  Let  me  give  you  an \\nexample—my former business manager, Mark Ramsay. I first met \\nMark when  he was  an  accountant for  another business  manager \\nwho  specialized  in  entertainment  clients.  He  was  an  unhappy \\ncamper back then, and he wanted to break out on his  own. After \\nmustering  enough  courage,  at the  age  of twenty-five, he  opened \\nhis own operation. I became his first client. \\n\\nMark became a regular at my dinner parties in New York. As \\na  client  and  a  friend,  Mark  would  return  the  favor  by  inviting \\nme  out  to  dinner  or  to  see  a  show.  After  a  few years,  however, \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c196 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nI  asked  Mark,  \"So  what\\'s  up  with  not  having  me  over  to  your \\nhome for dinner?\" A meal at someone\\'s home, after all, is what I \\nenjoy most. ', 'His answer was all too common, especially among the younger \\npeople I mentor. He told me, \"I could never do a dinner party like \\nyours.  I  don\\'t have that kind of money and I  live  in  a run-down \\nstudio. I don\\'t even have a dining table.\" \\n\\n\"Dining table! Who needs a dining table?\" I said. \\nWith that, I convinced Mark to give it a try. I told him I\\'d be his \\nanchor guest and suggested that he invite four others for dinner. I \\ntold him to get some simple wine, but plenty of it. For appetizers, \\nset  out  chips  and  salsa,  or  dip  with  vegetables.  Buy  a  foldable \\nround tabletop  that one can easily find and place  it on the coffee \\ntable. Voila!—you\\'ve got yourself a grand dining table. \\n\\nFor  food,  I  told  him,  forget  about  cooking.  Get  some  salads \\nand a roasted chicken from the deli. For dessert, buy some cookies \\nand ice cream, and keep the wine flowing. \\n\\nThe party was a huge success. Mark invited a potential client, ', \"clients. \\n\\nYou see, there's only one real rule to these get-togethers: Have \\nfun. All right, there are a few other rules that might help you along \\nthe way. Among them: \\n\\n1. Create a theme. \\n\\nThere  is  no  reason  that  a  small  dinner  party should  not  have  a \\ntheme.  One  simple  idea  can  help  you  pull  the  food  and  atmos \\nphere together. You  can build a party around anything, really.  It \\ncould be your mother's meatloaf recipe, a holiday, black tie (used \\nrarely, as we want  people to be totally comfortable), vegan food, \\nspecific  music—whatever  you  like.  People  will  get  jazzed  when \\nthey know you're being creative. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cFind Anchor Tenants and Feed Them \\n\\n197 \\n\\nI remember one example of a theme being put to good use that \\ncomes  from  an  article  I  read years  ago  in  the  Washington  Post, \\nabout  a  woman  named  Perdita  Huston.  When  President  Carter \", 'Africa, the Near East, Asia, and the Pacific in 1978, she started her \\nweekly For Women Only dinner parties. \\n\\nThe dinner parties filled a void for Huston, who explained how \\nshe  came  up  with  the  idea.  \"Because  of the  size  of the  region  I \\nadministered for the Peace Corps, I was obliged to do much trav \\neling. \\n\\n\"When  I  wasn\\'t  out  of  town  on  Peace  Corps  business,  I \\nthought it important to be at home with my son, Pierre, who was \\nthen  seven years  old. Also, because of my travels, I  began losing \\ntouch with many of my friends, but instead of trying to see people \\none-on-one in restaurant situations, I devised this scheme of giv \\ning weekly dinner parties. \\n\\n\"Right about that same time, I also came to realize there were \\na lot of women  in my situation:  single women  in high-level jobs \\nwhose  professional  lives  were  presenting  certain  problems  and \\noften overwhelming their private lives. In many ways, the women \\nin the Carter administration were pioneers who needed support \\nive networking, so I decided to limit my guests to women only. ', '\"What I did was simply expand my Sunday cooking to include \\npreparations  for  a  Monday-night  meal  for  twelve.  I  would  often \\nmake  couscous  or  a  lamb-based  soup,  which  is  used  during \\nRamadan  in  Algeria  to  break  the  fast  at  sundown.  It\\'s  called \\nchorba, which means  soup; in fact, it\\'s  called The Soup. It\\'s very \\nspicy and  good  enough  to  be  an  entire meal.  Often  I would just \\nprepare a huge tureen of it along with hot bread and a big salad. \\nDesserts were simply fruit and cheese. \\n\\n\"The  response to my Monday-night For Women  Only dinner \\nwas really overwhelming,\" she continued. \"I always used my finest \\nchina and crystal and silver candlesticks. In other words, I treated \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c198 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nthese  occasions  the way most hostesses  treat  conventional  male/ \\nfemale dinner parties. \\n\\n\"Our  dinner-table  conversations  are  unusually  candid.  We \\ntalk—or  argue—about  U.S.  foreign  policy  or  discuss  problems ', 'combat stereotypes or sexism in the workplace. \\n\\n\"We get a lot of feedback from each other and, because of our \\nexperience,  can  suggest  various  people  to  see,  organizations  to \\ncontact, or strategies to develop. Because they are so  supportive, \\nthese dinners have become very important to many of us.\" \\n\\nHuston\\'s weekly parties became an institution in the Washing \\nton,  D.C.,  area where  she  lived.  It  brought  like-minded  women \\ntogether  who  bonded  and  supported  one  another  through  the \\nsimilar trials and tribulations each was going through. There\\'s no \\nreason you  can\\'t  do  the  same  thing.  Creating  a  theme  around  a \\npoint of commonality—be it race, religion, gender, occupation, or \\nanything else—can infuse your get-togethers with added purpose, \\nand help you attract others. \\n\\n2. Use  invitations. \\n\\nWhile  I\\'m  all for slapdash  impromptu parties, the dinner parties \\nthat  will  be  most  successful  will  be  those  you\\'ve  devoted  some \\ntime  and  energy to.  Whether  by  phone,  e-mail,  or  handwritten ', \"advance—so people can have a chance to plan accordingly—and \\nso you'll know who is and who is not coming. \\n\\n3. Don't be a kitchen slave. \\n\\nThere's no sense in a party being all work. If you can't hire a caterer, \\neither cook all the food ahead of time or just use takeout. If the food \\nis good and the presentation snazzy, your guests will be impressed. \\nThese days, I usually opt for a caterer. But you can have a sim-\\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cFind Anchor Tenants and Feed Them \\n\\n199 \\n\\nilarly elegant  party for much  less  if you're willing to  get creative \\nand  spend  some  time  preparing.  The  key to  low-budget  dinner \\nparties is to keep it simple. Make one large dish, like a stew or chili \\nthat can be prepared a day or two ahead of time. Serve it with great \\nbread and salad. That's all you need. \\n\\nWell, maybe not ALL you need. My other expense is alcohol. I \\nlove—love!—great wine.  I  always  go  a  little  overboard with  the \", \"lubricant?  It  amounts  to  the  finest  party favor  ever  created.  But \\nagain, everyone has their own predilections, and I'm sure you can \\npull off a perfectly fabulous dinner party with just soda. \\n\\n4. Create  atmosphere. \\n\\nMake sure to spend an hour or two gussying up your place. Noth \\ning expensive or out of the ordinary, mind you. Candles, flowers, \\ndim lighting, and music set a good mood. Add a nice centerpiece \\nto  the  dinner table.  Get a young family member to walk around \\nserving drinks if you don't have a bartender or waiter. The point is \\nto give your guests all the signals they need to understand that it's \\ntime to enjoy. \\n\\n5. Forget being formal. \\n\\nMost dinner parties don't call for anything fancy. Follow the KISS \\nprinciple (Keep It Simple, Silly). Good food. Good people. Lots of \\nwine. Good conversation. That's a successful dinner party. I always \\nunderdress just so no one else feels they did. Jeans and a jacket are \\nmy standard fare, but you judge for yourself. \\n\\n6. Don't seat couples together. \", \"The essence of a good dinner party lies in seating everyone prop \\nerly. If you seat couples together, things can get boring. Mix and \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c200 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nmatch,  putting  people  together  who  don't  know  each  other  but \\nperhaps share  an  interest of some kind.  I like to  set placeholders \\nwhere I want people to sit. Each placeholder is a simple card with \\nthe guest's name on it. If I have the time, I love to put an interest \\ning question or joke on the back of the card that guests can use to \\nbreak the ice with one another. Or you can go out and buy funny \\ngreeting cards just to make things interesting. \\n\\n7. Relax. \\n\\nGuests  take  their  cues  from  the host—if you're having fun,  odds \\nare that they will, too. The night of the party, your job is to enjoy \\nall the fruits of your labor. That's an order. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cSECTION  FOUR \\n\\nTrading Up and Giving Back \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cC H A P T ER \", \"22 \\n\\nBe Interesting \\n\\nI remember  when  being  a  marketer  was  simpler.  Essentially, \\n\\nmarketers were expected to create an ad, get it to the consumer \\nthrough one of the few available media sources, and then sit back \\nand wait. \\n\\nThose days are good and gone. The way the world speaks and \\nlistens has changed radically. And the tools we use to communicate \\nare changing at a similar pace. As access to consumers grows, so \\ndoes consumer power. They can choose from hordes of entertain \\nment venues,  use  software  tools  to  filter  out  unwanted messages, \\nand  shoot  down  surviving  messages  with  a  heightened  sense  of \\ncynicism. It's just not as easy to be heard. Brand loyalty is tougher \\nto achieve. Conventional advertising and marketing just won't cut \\nit—and neither will traditional thinking among those who want to \\nget their message across. The CMO  of today and tomorrow must \\nbe a strategist, a technologist, creative, and always focused on the \\nsales and financial return on his marketing investments. Not a lot \\nof  individuals,  consulting  firms,  or  agencies  combine  all  those \", 'the CEO who expects all this is too often a frustrated one. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c204 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nMy growing sense of these changes, along with  conversations \\nwith respected marketers, is the main reason I founded Ferrazzi-\\nGreenlight,  to  focus  on  marketing  strategies  and  programs  that \\npush the marketing spend closer to actual sales. To count less on \\nbig broadcast advertising and more on building personalized loy \\nalty between clients and their customers. That might mean creat \\ning a loyalty program for a retailer similar to what we operated at \\nStarwood Hotels. Or designing an infomercial for a complex new \\nproduct launch.  Or  facilitating  an \"ambassador\\'s  program\" for a \\nlarge engineering firm that targeted just 500 customers, prospects, \\nand infiuencers in the United States. \\n\\nI hope it\\'s not a surprise that I see effective marketing as just \\nbuilding relationships with customers and prospective customers. \\nLet me translate this macro trend to a very personal scene that \\nrepeats itself over and over again when I give lectures at colleges. It \\nwill take place just before or after I\\'ve given my talk. A student will \\nmuster the nerve to  approach me, and admiring as  I  am  of such ', 'said beyond, \"Hi, I\\'m so-and-so and your talk was great.\" Perhaps \\nI\\'ll ask what they got out of it or how they see what I talked about \\nplaying out around them in the world.

How can you offer your company or your network anything \\nof value if you have not thought about how you want to stand out \\nand differentiate yourself in building that relationship? \\n\\nMarketers and networkers alike take heed:  Be interesting! All \\nthat you\\'ve read thus far doesn\\'t relieve you of the responsibility of \\nbeing  someone worth  talking  to,  and  even  better, worth  talking \\nabout. Virtually everyone  new you  meet  in  a  situation  is  asking \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cBe Interesting ', '205 \\n\\nthemselves  a variation on  one question: \"Would I want to  spend \\nan hour eating lunch with this person?\" \\n\\nConsultants call it the airport question. In the lengthy interview \\nprocess that that industry has become famous for—a peppering of \\ncomplicated case studies and logic-testing puzzles—the one ques \\ntion  consultants  use to  choose one  person  over a pool of equally \\ntalented candidates is the one question they ask only of themselves: \\n\"If I were trapped in John F. Kennedy Airport for a few hours [and \\nall travel-weary consultants inevitably spend too much time in air \\nports], would I want to spend it with this person?\" \\n\\nHave  you  mentioned  in  conversation  your  large  jazz  collec \\ntion, or the time you spent in the Ivory Coast, or your contrarian \\nviews  on  some  political  debate?

It  shows \\nyou're interested and involved in the world around you. \\n\\nWhat  happens  when  you  don't  have  a  platform  of  ideas  to \\n\\ndefend? When you're running for office, you lose an election. \\n\\nIn my sophomore year at Yale, I ran for New Haven City Coun \\ncil.  The  party in  New Haven  wanted  an  outspoken,  presentable \\ncandidate  to  run  against  the  less-than-exciting  opposing  candi \\ndate.  I had been known through my involvement in the  Political \\nUnion  as  a  very  young  chairman,  having  started  one  of  the \\nfirst  fraternities on campus  (Sigma Chi), and therefore had some \", \"didn't have a thought as to what I had to offer or why New Haven \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c206 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nmight want me as its representative. This was more ego than fore \\nthought. \\n\\nTo this day, my loss in that election sticks in my craw. I actually \\nrefused  to  dig  in  and  really  campaign,  to  learn  the  local  issues. \\nMy opponent, Joel  Ratner,  developed  a  deep  local  platform  and \\ntook to  the  streets  and  dining halls.  I  shied  away from that level \\nof  engagement,  expecting  that  my  dynamic  style  would  carry \\nthe day. \\n\\nJoel was emboldened by his ideas, and his passion galvanized \\nvoters. I, on the other hand, just thought it would be cool to run \\nfor  an  elected  office.  After  all,  I  was  recruited.  I  didn't  seek  the \\noffice, and I told the party up front that my studies and other lead \\nership responsibilities had to come  first. \\n\\nWell,  my  defeat was  embarrassing,  and  it  was  my own  fault. \", \"organization I represented or what professional avenue I pursued \\nin the future, all my efforts had to be powered by a deep  passion \\nand a set of beliefs that went well beyond my own personal bene \\nfit.  To  move  others,  you  have  to  speak  beyond  yourself.  Boldly \\nputting yourself out  there was  one  thing,  and  a  good thing,  but \\nthat wasn't enough. There was a difference between getting atten \\ntion  and  getting  attention  for  your  desire  to  change  the  world. \\nCongratulations, Joel, I hear you did a great job. The better man \\nclearly won in that race. \\n\\nBe a Person of Content: Have a Unique Point of View \\n\\nBeing  interesting  isn't  just  about  learning  how  to  become  a \\ngood conversationalist. Don't get me wrong, that is important, but \\nyou need a well-thought-out point of view. I honestly hope from \\nnow on you'll be a newspaper-reading maniac ready to engage the \\ntopics of the day with anyone you meet. But being interesting and \\nhaving  content  are  very  different.  The  former  involves  talking \", \"www.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cBe Interesting \\n\\n207 \\n\\nintelligently  about  politics,  sports,  travel,  science,  or  whatever \\nyou'll need as  a ticket of admission to  any conversation.  Content \\ninvolves a much more  specialized form of knowledge.  It's know \\ning what you  have  that  most  others  do  not.  It's  your  differentia \\ntion. It's your expertise. It's the message that will make your brand \\nunique, attracting others to become a part of your network. \\n\\nBeing known is just notoriety. But being known for something \\nis  entirely different.  That's  respect. You have to  believe  in  some \\nthing, as Joel Ratner did, for people to believe in you. \\n\\nOnce I learned my lesson, I wasn't going to repeat it. I was not \\njust going to be another generalist. I was going to have a unique \\npoint of view, an expertise. My first job out of college at Imperial \\nChemical Industries, I mastered the ins and outs of Total Quality \\nManagement. Later, when I worked at Deloitte, reengineering was \", \"mastered interactive marketing. Today, I've wrapped all my expe \\nriences into a set of beliefs around the radically changing dynam \\nics  of  marketing  overall  and  its  evolution  toward  relationship \\nmarketing: moving marketing dollars closer to sales. \\n\\nIn every job and at every stage in my career, I had some exper \\ntise,  some  content  that  differentiated  me  from  others  and  made \\nme  unique,  made  me  more  valuable  in  my  relationships  with \\nothers  and the company I worked for. It created precious oppor \\ntunities for me to  gain credibility and visibility in my field. Con \\ntent is a cause, an idea, trend, or skill—the unique subject matter \\non which you are the authority. \\n\\nWhat will  set you apart from everybody else is the relentless-\\nness you bring to learning and presenting and selling your content. \\nTake, for example, my experience when I was hired as CEO of YaYa. \\nThe company's board was aware of how I had used reengineering \\nto heighten the market's perception of Deloitte, and how, at Star \\nwood,  the  idea  of  changing  the  way  the  hospitality  industry \", '\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c208 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nability  to  capture  a  buzz-worthy  message  and  get  it  into  the \\ncrowded marketplace of ideas would prove crucial for a new com \\npany whose  product was  totally  untested.  This  seemed  right  for \\nme. I was a \"market maker\": someone who could create excitement \\nand belief around YaYa\\'s  point of view. The problem was  coming \\nup  with  the  credible  and  unique  point  of view that  people were \\nready to buy. That was our challenge, or the company would fail. \\n\\nOne of our first goals when I came to YaYa was to find a hook \\nthat  could  transform  the  company\\'s  current  lack  of  sales  while \\nalso  generating  broader  intrigue  in  the  marketplace,  and  really \\ncreate a market. I started, as I always do, by immersing myself in \\nthe subject.  I became a voracious  reader and would spend hours \\nlate  at  night  checking  out  a  variety  of  articles,  analyst  reports, ', \"tants  who  specialized  in  the  interactive  advertising  industry, \\ngames industry, and training world. \\n\\nThis  stage  can  be  quite  frustrating.  There's  a  huge  learning \\ncurve  to  get  up  to  speed.  Suddenly  you're  confronted  with  a \\nmiasma  of numbers, data  points, differing  opinions, and  a boat \\nload of disparate new information. On some occasions, as was the \\ncase  with  TQM  and  reengineering,  you  can  acquire  content  by \\nsimply  appropriating  another  person's  innovative  ideas  and \\nbecome  a  leader  in  distributing  and  applying  those  ideas.  On \\nother occasions, as with YaYa, we had to develop the content from \\nscratch.  That meant taking  all  the  disparate  dots  of information \\nand connecting them in a way others had not. \\n\\nThere  should  be  no  mystique  around  dot  connecting  among \\nthose who are continually at the forefront of business innovation. \\nRemember  those  wise  words  of Mark  McCormack  in  his  book \", 'in business  is  often nothing more than making connections that \\neveryone  else  has  almost  thought  of. You  don\\'t  have  to  reinvent \\nthe wheel, just attach it to a new wagon.\" \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cBe Interesting \\n\\n209 \\n\\nAs my immersion process continued, I became more and more \\nfrustrated  that  the  marketing  and  training  field  was  not  taking \\nadvantage of the two powerful new mediums that YaYa was based \\non—the Internet and video games. As I learned more about mar \\nketing and training online, I drew analogies to other new mediums \\nthat  changed the  landscape.  I  reminded marketers  that when we \\nfirst transitioned from radio to television, all we did was put a cam \\nera in front of a radio announcer and call it advertising. It took a \\nwhile to settle into the medium and its new rules. Here again, with \\nthe Internet, we were applying old models to a new environment. \\nThe  Net  was  all  about  interactivity  and  community  building, \\nwhere  concepts  or  just  jokes  were  spread  around  the  world  in ', \"like billboards and bumper stickers, and putting them online in the \\nform of banner ads. That those ads weren't successful should have \\ncome as no surprise. Training had a similar argument. Would you \\nrather engage in learning in a fun interactive environment or the \\ntraditional  and stale forms  of training that employees were being \\nforce-fed today? Which would be more effective? \\n\\nThen you had the games world in general. The startling num \\nbers  suggested  an  untapped  phenomenon.  In  1999,  games  rev \\nenues surpassed movie box-office revenues. And the demographic \\nof online gamers was changing radically as content was branching \\nout  to  cater  to  adults  and  women.  The  average  age  of  online \\ngamers is now thirty-five, 49 percent of whom are women. I also \\nlearned of a German company that developed a cool turkey-shoot \\ngame for Johnnie Walker that got so many downloads, the prime \\nminister  commented  that  the  game  had  become  a  drain  on \\nnational productivity. Still, no one thought of games  as anything \\nbut niche entertainment. \\n\\nWith the information at hand, I now had to  connect the dots \", 'a  fantasy  world  with  no  limitations  or  constraints.  Instead  of \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c210 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nbashing my head against the wall trying harder and harder to solve \\na specific problem, I like to ask the question: \"If I could use some \\nmagical potion in this situation, what could I do with all this new \\ninformation?\"  Such  fantasizing  doesn\\'t  have  to  be,  and  often \\nshouldn\\'t be, a solitary endeavor. I get other interested parties— \\nemployees, colleagues, and insiders—to help me create wild sce \\nnarios and ask seemingly absurd questions. I did this with a small \\ngroup, and we threw out each and every fantastical idea that came \\nto us. By fantasizing, using the magic potion, and including a group \\nof people to riff without rules, we were able to use our creativity to \\nfind  a way forward. \\n\\nThese fantasy sessions were productive. We started to imagine \\nhow games might be applied to more than just leisure and enter \\ntainment. We started to question assumptions such as what busi \\nness we were  in  (was  it  entertainment, marketing,  or  services?), ', 'consulting,  enabling  technology?),  and  who  our  real  customers \\ncould be (geeky adolescents, adults, Fortune 500 companies?). We \\nstarted to visualize how we might connect the gaming medium— \\nwhich  had  a  large  and  growing  demographic  of users—and  the \\nInternet medium—which had a large and growing group of com \\npanies trying to figure out how best to use it to interact with their \\ncustomers. \\n\\nAs an entrepreneur or an employee, you have the creative abilities \\nto make similar connections in your own industry. How do I know? \\nBecause  everyone has  them! Your  abilities  may be  stored  away or \\ninfrequently used, but they are there. The question is, how do you \\nput them to work for you? We went to work to crack this nut. \\n\\nThe results were significant. We realized there was an opportu \\nnity to not just sell games or sell advertising onto game sites but to \\ncreate interactive games online to be used as a powerful and new \\nimmersive form  of advertising. When  people redefined YaYa as a \\nmarketing company rather than a video-game company, we real-\\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cBe Interesting ', \"211 \\n\\nized our customers weren't the end users; our real customers were \\nthe  companies  who  wanted  access  to  the  end  users.  The  shift  in \\nfocus  allowed  us  to  see  games  less  as  a  product than  a medium \\nitself, able to deliver any kind of message one wanted to send. You \\ncould  use  games  to  train  and  educate  employees,  as  advertising \\nvehicles,  in  brand-awareness  campaigns,  in  direct  one-to-one \\nmarketing,  as  a  means  for  collecting  data  on  the  preferences  of \\ncustomers, and so on. Where television eventually turned to com \\nmercials  to  replace  the  on-air  radio  personality,  games  could \\nreplace banner ads on the Internet. \\n\\nAnd  thus  the  unique  point  of view  for  YaYa  was  born.  We \\n\\nbegan to trumpet advergaming and edutainment as the next pow \\nerful  communications medium, an untapped marketing segment \\nperfect  for  product  placements,  branded  gaming  events,  custom \", 'long before  I was  not only attending  games  conferences but also \\nspeaking at them. \\n\\nOnce a resonating pitch is perfected, getting attention is less of \\na problem. Journalists are hungry for ideas. Getting access to them \\nis often as simple as calling the magazine or newspaper they work \\nfor,  which  can  be  found  on  their Web  site,  and  asking  to  speak \\nwith the reporter that covers your beat. I\\'ve never met a journalist \\nwith  a  gatekeeper.  Moreover,  I\\'ve  never  had  my  calls  go  unre-\\nturned after leaving a message that said, \"I\\'ve got the inside scoop \\non how the gaming industry is going to revolutionize marketing. \\nI\\'ve appreciated your work for a long time now; I believe you are \\nthe right person to break this story.\" \\n\\nI\\'ve been leaving  those kinds  of messages  on  reporters\\' voice \\nmail for years, and reporters are hugely appreciative. Most of the \\ntime, the story doesn\\'t even involve my company or me. I\\'m just \\nbuilding the credibility I\\'ll need when the day comes to make my \\nown  pitch.

The answer \\nis that I understand and give them what they need: great stories. \\n\\nHowever,  I\\'ve  also  had  a  lot  of help.  Once  I  had  developed \\nYaYa\\'s  unique  point  of  view,  for  example,  I  brought  it  to  the \\nad agencies. It was interactive agency KPE that brought YaYa and \\nadvergaming to market. They were the agency to \"discover\" us and \\nwhat  we  were  doing.  And  then  the  big  games  companies  got \\ninvolved. I went to the most progressive guys I knew, people like \\nBobby Kotick, the CEO  of Activision who, in a partnership with ', 'behind  measuring  how  effective  games  were  as  a  medium  for \\nadvertisers.  Bobby  and  I  would  be  on  CNN  or  CNBC  back-to-\\nback plugging each other\\'s ideas. \\n\\n\"Keith, what\\'s  your  secret?  Bribes, blackmail—come  on, just \\ntell  me,\" one CEO  friend jokingly asked after YaYa  appeared in  a \\nmajor spread in Fortune, while his own company, which was four \\ntimes larger than YaYa, and several years older, had barely made it \\ninto its own newsletter. \\n\\nSo  I  told  him:  \"Create  a  story  about  your  company  and  the \\nideas it embodies that readers will care about. That\\'s your content. \\nThen  share  it.  Have  you  ever  picked  up  the  phone  and  actually \\ntalked to a reporter about why you think what you do is so special? \\nYou cannot outsource this to PR; journalists deal with thousands \\nof PR people a day.

They are the celebrities \\nof their little worlds, and their fame  comes from  always  seeming \\nto be one step ahead. \\n\\nSo how did they get that way? The easiest route is by expertise. \\nAs I look back on my career, the recipe seems straightforward: \\nI'd  latch  on  to  the  latest,  most  cutting-edge  idea  in  the  business \\nworld.  I'd  immerse  myself in  it,  getting  to  know  all  the  thought \\nleaders  pushing  the  idea  and  all  the  literature  available.  I'd  then \\ndistill that into a message about the idea's broader impact to others \", 'the  content.  Becoming  an  expert was  the  easy part.  I  simply did \\nwhat experts do: I taught, wrote, and spoke about my expertise. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c214 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nAt ICI, my first job after college, I talked my way into a man \\nagement-training program by convincing the  interviewer to  take \\non  a liberal  arts  major  as  an  experiment.  Every trainee who  had \\never been hired prior to  that had  some  fancy degree  in  chemical \\nengineering, material sciences, or something technical like that. \\n\\nThere was no way I was going to advance at ICI based on my \\nengineering  expertise.  In  my  first  few  months  of  the  program, \\nhowever,  I  noticed  that  Total  Quality  Management  was  all  the \\nrage, one of those consultant-driven business trends that light the \\nbusiness world on fire every few years. \\n\\nIn my free time, I studied all the texts that were available. A few \\n\\nmonths into my job, I volunteered my \"expertise,\" citing my back \\nground in  organizational  behavior  (from my total  of two  under ', 'ICI\\'s three go-to guys when it came to TQM.

I would go on to parlay my experience \\ninto  giving  speeches, writing  articles, and  connecting with  some \\nof the top  business  minds  in  the  country. After a  short period, I \\neven persuaded the industrial giant ICI to craft a new position for \\nme within a newly forming group as one of the leaders of TQM in \\nNorth America. \\n\\nThere\\'s  no  better  way  to  learn  something,  and  become  an \\nexpert at it, than to have to teach it.

As I did at ICI and Deloitte, you can find someone \\nwho has already connected the dots and become an expert of their \\ncontent.

Get out in front and analyze the trends and \\nopportunities  on  the  cutting edge. \\n\\nForesight  gives you  and your  company the flexibility to  adapt  to \\nchange. Creativity allows you to take advantage of it. Today, where \\ninnovation  has  become  more  important  than  production,  not \\nmoving  forward  means  going  backward.  Early  adaptors,  trend-\\nspotters,  knowledge  brokers,  change  agents,  and  all  those  who \\nknow where their industry is heading and what next big ideas are \\ncoming down the pike have become the stars of the business world. \\nIdentify the people in your industries who  always  seem to  be \\nout in front, and use all the relationship  skills you've acquired to \\nconnect with them. Take them to lunch. Read their newsletters. In \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c216 \", 'Never Eat Alone \\n\\nfact, read everything you can. Online, there are hundreds of indi \\nviduals  distilling information, analyzing it, and making prognos \\ntications.  These  armchair  analysts  are  the  eyes  and  ears  of \\ninnovation.  Now  get  online  and  read,  read,  read.  Subscribe  to \\nmagazines,  buy books,  and  talk  to  the  smartest  people  you  can \\nfind.  Eventually, all this knowledge will build on itself, and you\\'ll \\nstart making connections others aren\\'t. \\n\\n2.  Ask  seemingly  stupid  questions. \\n\\nIf you ask questions that are like no other, you get results that are \\nunlike  any that  the  world  has  seen.  How many  people  have  the \\ncourage to ask those questions? The answer: all the people respon \\nsible for the greatest innovations. \"Don\\'t you think having all your \\nMP3s  on a little Walkman-like device would be cool?\" Thus, the \\niPod. \"Why can\\'t we view our  pictures  immediately?\"  Thus,  the ', 'Why not give it to them quickly?\" Thus, McDonald\\'s and the fast-\\nfood  industry. \\n\\nThe power of innocence in business is wonderfully depicted in \\na scene from the movie Big, where Tom Hanks plays a kid trans \\nformed into an adult. In one poignant moment, Hanks is sitting in \\non  an  executive  meeting  at  a  major  toy  company,  and  one  vice \\npresident is PowerPointing his way through a presentation about \\na new toy. All the numbers work. All the graphs point to a success \\nful product launch. And yet Hanks\\'s childlike innocence prompts \\nhim to  say, \"I don\\'t get it.\" In actually playing with the toy, as he \\nhad,  all  the  graphs  and  numbers  didn\\'t  matter:  The  toy  simply \\nwasn\\'t  fun.  Sometimes  the  numbers  do  lie.  Sometimes  all  the \\nPowerPoint presentations  in the world won\\'t  provide  cover for  a \\ncompany that has forgotten to ask the most basic of questions. \\n\\nFor  years,  the  people  running  the  companies  that  produced \\ngames believed they were in the entertainment business. I asked, ', \"\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cBe Interesting \\n\\n217 \\n\\n3. Know  yourself and your  talents. \\n\\nI had no chance competing with the science geeks at ICI. In devel \\noping  an  expertise  that  highlighted  my  strengths,  I  was  able  to \\novercome my weaknesses. The trick is not to work obsessively on \\nthe  skills  and  talents  you  lack,  but  to  focus  and  cultivate  your \\nstrengths so that your weaknesses matter less. I'd apply the 80/20 \\nrule  in  that you  should  spend  some  time  getting  better  at  your \\nweaknesses but really focus on building your strengths. \\n\\n4. Always learn. \\n\\nYou  have  to  learn  more  to  earn  more.  All  content-creators  are \\nreaders or at least deep  questioners or conversationalists. They're \\nalso sticklers when it comes to self-development. Your program of \\nself-development  should  include  reading  books  and  magazines, \\nlistening to  educational tapes, attending three to five conferences \\na year, taking a course or two, and developing relationships with \", \"\\n5. Stay  healthy. \\n\\nResearch has discovered that at midafternoon, due to sleep depri \\nvation, the average corporate executive today has the alertness level \\nof a  seventy-year-old. You  think  that  executive  is  being  creative \\nor connecting the dots? Not a chance. Sounds hokey, but you have \\nto  take  care  of yourself—your  body,  mind,  and  spirit—to  be  at \\nyour best. As hectic as my schedule can get, I never miss a workout \\n(five times  a week). I  try to  take  a five-day vacation  every other \\nmonth  (I  do  check e-mails  and  catch  up  on  reading). I  go  on  a \\nspirituality retreat once a month, even if it's a one-day local med \\nitation  retreat. And I  do  something spiritual each week—usually \\nchurch.  That  gives me  energy to  allow me to keep  my otherwise \\ntwenty-four-hour  schedule. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c218 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\n6.  Expose yourself to  unusual experiences. \", 'When  management  guru  Peter Drucker was  asked  for  one  thing \\nthat would make a person better in business, he responded, \"Learn \\nto  play  the  violin.\"  Different  experiences  give  rise  to  different \\ntools. Find out what your kids are interested in and why. Stimulate \\nyour creativity. Learn about things that are out of the mainstream. \\nTravel  to  weird  and  exotic  places.  Knowing  one\\'s  own  industry \\nand one\\'s native markets is not enough to compete in the future. \\nTake  a  deep  and  boundless  curiosity  about  things  outside  your \\nown profession  and comfort zone. \\n\\n7. Don\\'t get discouraged. \\n\\nMy  first  e-mail  to  the  CEO  of  ICI  regarding  TQM  was  never \\nreturned. To this day, I face rejection on a regular basis. If you\\'re \\ngoing  to  be  creative,  cutting  edge,  out  of the  mainstream, you\\'d \\nbetter get used to rockin\\' the boat. And guess what—when you\\'re \\nrockin\\' the boat, there will always be people who will try and push ', 'sionals need to know the score: Passion keeps you going through \\nthe  rough  times  come  hell  or  high  water,  and  both  will  come. \\nThere will be  continual  changes  and challenges  requiring you to \\nbe persistent and committed. Focus on the results and keep your \\neyes open for what is happening on the edges of your industry. \\n\\n8. Know the  new technology. \\n\\nNo  industry moves  quicker or places more  emphasis  on  innova \\ntion. You  don\\'t  need  to  be  a \"techno  geek,\" but  you  do  need  to \\nunderstand  the  impact  of  technology  on  your  business  and  be \\nable to leverage it to your benefit. Adopt a techno geek, or at least \\nhire or sire one. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cBe Interesting \\n\\n219 \\n\\n9. Develop a niche. \\n\\nSuccessful small businesses that gain renown establish themselves \\nwithin a carefully selected market niche that they can realistically \\nhope  to  dominate.  Individuals  can  do  the  same  thing.  Think of \\nseveral  areas where your company underperforms  and choose to ', \"\\nA former  mentee  of mine, for  example, works  for  a  growing \\nstart-up  that offers  a new kind  of pet product.  Not long  after he \\nwas hired, he noted that  one  of the  countless  issues  the  start-up \\nwas struggling with was pricey postal rates that were cutting into \\nthe  company's margins.  Frankly, that's not the kind of issue that \\nregisters very high up  on the totem pole of priorities for a start \\nup, but then again, this mentee wasn't very high up either. \\n\\nHe took it upon himself to research the problem by calling the \\nofficial responsible for small business at UPS, FedEx, and others. A \\nfew weeks later, he sent a  detailed memo  to the  CEO  about how \\nthe company could reduce its postal costs. The CEO was delighted. \\nThe mentee's  niche  expertise  in  mail branded the young man  as \\na  valuable  up-and-comer  in  the  company,  and  these  days,  he's \\ndeveloping expertise in issues much farther up the totem pole. \\n\\n10. Follow the money. \\n\\nCreativity is worthless  if it  can't be  applied.  The bottom line for \", 'lifeblood of any company is sales and cash flow. All great ideas are \\nmeaningless in business until someone pays for it. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c220 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nCONNECTORS\\'  HALL  OF  FAME  PROFILE \\n\\nD a l ai  Lama \\n\\n\"Use your content to tell stones that move people.\" \\n\\nKnown  as  a  world  leader,  holy  man,  diplomat,  hero,  and  the \\n\\nTibetan  Ghandi,  the  Dalai  Lama  simply prefers  to  be  recognized  as \\n\\n\"a  simple  Buddhist  monk—no  more,  no  less.\" \\n\\nOn  his  great  ascent  toward  world  renown  ever  since  his  escape \\n\\nfrom  his  homeland  in  Tibet—fleeing  the  occupying  armies  of China \\n\\nin  the  late  1950s—this  unique  national  figure  has  captured  the \\n\\npublic  imagination,  raised  millions  of  dollars,  and  rallied  celebri \\n\\nties,  politicians,  and  laymen  alike  to  his  cause  of  reclaiming  his ', \"homeland. \\n\\nWhat  can  the  aspiring  connector  learn  from  this  deeply  modest \\n\\nman? \\n\\nThe  answer:  Powerful  content  communicated  in  a  compelling \\n\\nstory  can  energize  your  network  to  help  you  achieve  your  mission. \\n\\nBecause  here's  the  thing  with  the  spiritual  leader  of  the  Tibetan \\n\\npeople:  Folks  give  him  money,  love,  and  support  even  though  he's \\n\\npeddling  neither  product  nor  service.

Not \", 'true.  The  Dalai  Lama  doesn\\'t  have  a  single  degree.  He  does,  how \\n\\never,  deliver  a  simple  but  profound  message  of  world  peace  and \\n\\ncompassion  packaged  in  colorful  stories  and  anecdotes—a  mes \\n\\nsage  that earned  him  the  Nobel  Peace  Prize  in  1 9 8 9. \\n\\nNow you  might  be  thinking:  \"Wait a  minute.

Your  story  won\\'t be  as  compelling  as  his. \\n\\nBut your  storyte///ng can  be.  Here\\'s  how: ', 'www.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cBe Interesting \\n\\n221 \\n\\nIn  telling  a  gripping  story,  the  Dalai  Lama  understands  that  the \\n\\nmessage  must  be  both  simple  and  universal.  Journalist  Chris  Colin, \\n\\nin  speculating  why  the  Dalai  Lama\\'s  cause  is  so  popular,  wrote, \\n\\n\"Perhaps  the  clarity of the  atrocity  resonates  in  the  West,  where  few \\n\\ninternational  disputes  seem  so  cut and  dried  .  .  .  Here,  in  a  nation \\n\\nnostalgic  for  the  seemingly  black-and-white  struggles  of the  compar \\n\\natively  simpler  past,  the  \\'Free  Tibet\\'  cause  has  wings.\" \\n\\nThough  he  is  one  of the  most  learned  scholars  of one  of the  most \\n\\ncomplex  of  all  the  world\\'s  philosophies,  the  Dalai  Lama  is  sure  not \\n\\nonly  to  present  his  cause  in  a  clear,  simple-to-understand  vision,  but ', 'he also goes to great lengths to show  how the cause  relates to  us all. \\n\\nThe  most  gripping  stories  are  those  concerning  identity—who \\n\\nwe  are,  where  we\\'ve  come  from,  and  where  we  are  going.  They \\n\\ntap  into  something  common  to  all  people.  The  Dalai  Lama  tells  us \\n\\nthat  to  be  concerned  with  the  Tibetan  people  is  to  be  concerned \\n\\nwith  yourself.  \"The  more  we  care  for  the  happiness  of  others,\"  he \\n\\nsays,  \"the  greater  our  own  sense  of  well-being  becomes.\"  In  this \\n\\nway,  he  shows  how  the  basic  concerns  of  all  people—happiness \\n\\nbased  on  contentment,  appeasement  of  suffering,  and  the  forging \\n\\nof meaningful  relationships—can  act as  the  foundation  for  universal \\n\\nethics  in  today\\'s world.  Thus,  he  appeals  to  his cause  by appealing ', 'to  everyone\\'s  cause. \\n\\nThat  doesn\\'t  mean  your  business,  your  resume,  or whatever  con \\n\\ntent you\\'re  trying  to  pitch  has  to  actually  be oversimplified  or  overly \\n\\nuniversal.  But you  should  figure  out  how to  spin your yarn  in  a  fash \\n\\nion  that a)  is  simple  to  understand,  and  b)  everybody can  relate  to. \\n\\nAnother  way  to  think  about  this  is  to  ask  yourself,  \"How  does  my \\n\\ncontent  help  others  answer who  they are,  where  they are  from,  and \\n\\nwhere  they  are  going?\" \\n\\nOn  some  level,  it\\'s  still  baffling  why  anyone  gives  money  to  the \\n\\nTibetan  cause.  For  the  Tibetan  cause,  arguably,  is  a  lost  one;  after \\n\\nfour  decades,  China  still  shows  no  signs  of  reversing  itself. \\n\\nAnd  still,  the  Dalai  Lama  persuades  people  to  donate  their ', 'money  and  energy.  How  does  he  do  it?  One  thing  he  does  is  use \\n\\nfacts  and  historical  examples  within  his  stories  to  stoke  our  pas \\n\\nsions.  He  does  not,  as  a  businessperson  might  do with  graphs  and \\n\\nanalysis,  attempt to  logically convince  us  of  his  position.  He  makes \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c222 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nus feel  his  position.  For example,  check out this  Q&A,  from  a  1 9 97 \\n\\ninterview  in  Mother Jones: \\n\\nQ:  What  do  you  think  it  will  take  for  China  to  change  its \\n\\npolicy  toward  Tibet? \\n\\nDalai  Lama:  It  will  take  two  things:  first,  a  Chinese  leader \\n\\nship  that  looks  forward \\n\\ninstead  of  backward, \\n\\nthat  looks \\n\\ntoward  integration  with  the world  and  cares  about  both  world ', \"opinion  and  the  will  of  [China's]  own  democracy  movement; \\n\\nsecond,  a  group  of world  leaders  that  listens  to  the  concerns \\n\\nof their  own  people with  regard  to Tibet,  and  speaks  firmly to \\n\\nthe  Chinese  about  the  urgent  need  of  working  out  a  solution \\n\\nbased  on  truth  and  justice.  We  do  not  have  these  two  things \\n\\ntoday,  and  so the  process of bringing  peace to Tibet is  stalled. \\n\\nBut  we  must  not  lose  our  trust  in  the  power  of  truth.  Every \\n\\nthing  is  always  changing  in  the  world.  Look  at  South  Africa, \\n\\nthe  former  Soviet  Union,  and  the  Middle  East.  They  still  have \\n\\nmany  problems,  setbacks  as  well  as  breakthroughs,  but  basi \\n\\ncally  changes  have  happened  that  were  considered  unthink \\n\\nable  a  decade  ago. \", 'What truly moves us as human beings, what prompts us into \\naction,  is  emotion.

I \\nknow how all my choices—what I wear, my conversational  style, ', '\\nImage and identity have become increasingly important in our \\nnew economic order. With the digital sea swelling in sameness and \\noverwhelmed  in  information,  a  powerful  brand—built  not  on  a \\nproduct  but  on  a  personal  message—has  become  a  competitive \\nadvantage. \\n\\nYour content will become the guiding star of your brand, help \\ning to integrate all your connecting efforts around a uniform and \\npowerful mission.  Good  personal  brands  do  three highly signifi \\ncant things for your network of contacts: They provide a credible, \\ndistinctive,  and  trustworthy  identity.  They project  a  compelling \\nmessage.  They  attract  more  and  more  people  to  you  and  your \\ncause,  as you\\'ll  stand  out in  an  increasing  cluttered world. As  a \\nresult, you will find it easier than ever to win new friends and have \\nmore of a say in what you do and where you work. \\n\\nIf I were to say, \"Swoosh,\" what comes to mind?

It \\nestablishes  your  worth.  It  takes  your  mission  and  content  and \\nbroadcasts  it  to  the  world.

The best brands, like the most \\ninteresting people, have a distinct message. \\n\\nYour  PBM  comes  from  your  content/unique  value  proposi \\ntion,  as  we  discussed  in  the  last  chapter,  and  a  process  of  self-\\nevaluation.  It involves finding out what's  really in  a name—your \", \"\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cBuild Your Brand \\n\\n229 \\n\\nput that uniqueness to work. It's not a specific task so much as the \\ncultivation of a mind-set. \\n\\nWhat do you want people to think when they hear or read your \\nname? What product or service can you best provide?  Take your \\nskills, combine them with your passions, and find out where in the \\nmarket, or within your own company, they can best be applied. \\n\\nYour message  is  always  an  offshoot  of your mission  and your \\ncontent. After you've  sat  down  and figured out who you want to \\nbe, and you've written goals in some version of ninety-day, three-\\nyear, and ten-year increments, you  can build a brand perception \\nthat supports all this. \\n\\nYour  positioning message  should  include  a  list  of words  that \\nyou  want  people  to  use  when  referring  to  you.  Writing  those \\nwords down are a big first step in having others believe them. Ask \\nyour most trusted friends what words they would use to describe \\nyou, for good and for bad. Ask them what are the most important \", '\\nWhen I was once hungry to become chief executive officer at a \\nFortune 500 company, my PBM read as follows: \"Keith Ferrazzi is \\ndefined  as  one  of the  most  innovative  and  bottom  line-focused \\nmarketers  and  CEOs  in  the world.

For  everyone  in  every  field—let\\'s  be \\nreal—looks count, so you\\'d better look polished and professional. \\nThere is one general, overarching caveat in this step: Stand out! \\nStyle  matters.  Whether  you  like  it  or  not,  clothing,  letterheads, \\nhairstyles, business cards, office space, and conversational style are \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c230 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nnoticed—big time.

That\\'s how you\\'ve become an \\nauthority in your company. But your job is not done. If the rest of \\nthe world isn\\'t familiar with how good you are, you and your com \\npany are only gaining part of the benefit. The fact is, you\\'ve got to ', 'become an authority not just in your company but in your industry. \\nIt comes  in  part from visibility.  I\\'m  not  suggesting you  stand \\non  your  local  street  corner  with  a  sign  on  a  sandwich  board \\nexclaiming, \"Put me on TV!\" Though come to think of i t . .. well, \\nlet\\'s  hold  off for  now.  I\\'ve  got  some  suggestions  on  high-stakes \\nself-promotion that will make your effort becoming known  a lit \\ntle bit easier, sans the public embarrassment. And I\\'m no stranger \\nto embarrassment. I\\'ve taken a few knocks to learn the right and \\nwrong ways to let others know about what I do. \\n\\nYou don\\'t have to look far to see why increased visibility might \\nbe important for your career, and for extending your network of \\ncolleagues and friends. Take, for example, self-promoting phenom \\nDonald Trump. How many other real estate moguls do you know \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c232 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\noffhand? Right—I can\\'t name anyone else either. Why is the \"The \\nDonald\"  considered  the  ultimate  dealmaker?  Probably  because ', \"cles  and  television  interviews  and  now  a  highly rated  TV  show. \\nBecause he has a book entitled The Art of the Deal. \\n\\nBut his  self-promotion is not just ego  (though by how much, \\nI'm  not  quite  sure);  it  makes  plenty  of business  sense,  too.  His \\nbuzz-worthy brand now has a value unto itself. Buildings with his \\nname on it are more valuable and bring in higher rental fees. When \\nThe Donald went bankrupt, banks that would have otherwise fore \\nclosed on any other struggling mogul gave Trump leeway, not only \\nbecause  they knew he was  good  at what he  did but because they \\nknew his name alone would go a long way in helping him recover \\nfrom his setbacks. Trump is a talented developer, but then so are a \\nlot of other people. The difference? He promotes himself. \\n\\nThe fact is that those people who are known beyond the walls \\nof their  own  cubicle  have  a  greater  value.  They  find  jobs  more \\neasily. They usually rise up the corporate ladder faster. Their net \\nworks begin to grow without much heavy lifting. \", 'I  can hear the groans  of discomfort already stirring. You may \\nbe thinking, \"I\\'m shy. I don\\'t like to talk about myself. Isn\\'t mod \\nesty a virtue?\" Well, I can assure you that if you hide your accom \\nplishments, they\\'ll remain hidden. If you don\\'t promote yourself, \\nhowever graciously, no one else will. \\n\\nLike it or not, your success is determined as much by how well \\nothers  know your work  as  by the  quality of your work.  Luckily, \\nthere are hundreds  of new channels  and mediums  for you to  get \\nthe word out. \\n\\nSo how do you promote Brand You? \\n\\nEvery day, you read  or hear about companies  in  newspapers, \\nmagazines,  on  television,  and  on  the Web.  Most  of the  time  the \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cBroadcast Your Brand \\n\\n233 \\n\\narticle or story is about celebrity CEOs and big companies. It\\'s not \\nbecause they are more deserving of the press than you or me. It\\'s \\nthe result of well-planned and strategic public relations. Big com \\npanies have PR machines working for them to shape and control ', \"\\nSmaller  companies  and  individuals  have  to  do  it themselves. \\nBut by using some pluck and a strategy of your own, access to the \\nmedia  is  not  as  difficult  as  you  may  think.  Journalists  do  less \\nsleuthing for their stories than you'd imagine. They get a majority \\nof their  stories  from  people  that  have  sought them  out,  and  not \\nthe  other way around. And like  everyone  else  in  any profession, \\nthey tend to  follow the herd. Which  means  once you  get written \\nabout, other reporters will come calling. Assigned you as a subject, \\nthey'll do a quick Google search, and presto: They'll find you are \\nan already cited source and will seek you out to cite you again. \\n\\nOne article creates visibility, which in turn will put you in front \\nof other journalists,  creating  the  possibility of more  articles  and \\nvisibility.

But why not broad \\ncast that same message to a thousand networks across the country? \\n\\nNow we're talking. \\nAs I mentioned before, when I became CEO of YaYa, it was a \\ncompany  with  virtually  no  revenue,  and  clearly  no  recognized \\nmarket. We had visionary founders, Jeremy Milken and Seth Ger-\\nson, but we needed a market. \\n\\nThere was, however, one company with a similar product. I'm \\ngoing to call them Big Boy Software. They had created a software \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c234 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\ntool  that  facilitated  the  actual  creation  of high-end  games.  They \\ntoo were trying to find their business model and generate revenue. \\nBoth  of us were in a race to become the established brand in the \\nnew market we were creating. \\n\\nSoon after we defined the advergaming space, Big Boy saw how \", \"selling games to big brands. They followed suit, positioning them \\nselves as competitors to YaYa. The main difference between them \\nand us was that they had way, way more money. They had raised a \\nhuge amount of capital that put our resources to shame. There is \\nno  need  to  go  into  the  comparative  details  of who  was  a  better \\ncompany (I'm a little biased, of course). But the fact remains, they \\nhad tons of resources and we did not—at all. \\n\\nSo how did YaYa become the market leader? \\nThe answer is, we created buzz: that powerful, widespread phe \\nnomenon  that  can  determine  the  future  of  individuals,  compa \\nnies, and movies alike. Buzz is the riddle every enterprising person \\nis trying to solve. It's a grassroots, word-of-mouth force that can \\nturn  a low-budget flick about a witch  into  a multimillion-dollar \\nblockbuster.  (Ever hear of The Blair Witch Project?) You feel its \\nenergy in Internet chat rooms, at the gym, on the street, and all of \\nit is stoked by a media hungry for the inside scoop. Buzz is mar \", '\\nHere\\'s  an  example  of how well it works:  Remember Napster? \\nOne day it was a clever software idea hatched in some kid\\'s dorm \\nroom allowing users online to link up and share MP3 music  files. \\nSix months later, it was  a  Silicon Valley start-up, the source of a \\nmajor lawsuit,  playing bandwidth  havoc with  servers  around the \\ncountry. Even when it was shut down, the name had enough buzz \\nto be bought for something like $50 million. \\n\\nAdvertising or a life-empowering endorsement by Oprah had \\nnothing to do with it. Napster was, well, cool. And as a result of \\nbuzz, it was very famous. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cBroadcast Your Brand \\n\\n235 \\n\\nAs a marketer, over the years, I have developed an idea of how \\nbuzz  is  created.  One  way  is  to  generate  what  I  call  \"catalytic \\nmoments.\" When you watch a big football game, have you noticed \\nhow the tide of a game will suddently turn in favor of one team or \\nthe other? It starts with a huge play, and in many cases is followed ', 'moment, an inside scoop, a crazy giveaway—something that will \\nget the crowd whispering. Unfortunately, YaYa was too young and \\npoor for such a strategy. \\n\\nAnother  way  is  to  report  compelling  news  by  leveraging  the \\npower of the media to get your brand sizzling. The Jesse Ventura for \\nGovernor of Minnesota campaign is a perfect example. Significantly \\noutspent by two major competitors, Ventura gained valuable media \\nexposure by persuading the media to report on things like his cre \\native use of advertising and a G.I. Joe-like action figure. Similarly, I \\nlook for compelling stories that create buzz within the news media. \\nThat\\'s where feeding the \"infiuentials\" comes  into  play. Infiu-\\nentials are what marketing wonks call those people who can ignite \\nbrand  buzz.  They  are  the  small  segment  of the  population  that \\nwill  adopt a cool  product  early on  and infect everyone  else with \\nthe bug.  They are  also the celebrities  and experts whose word is \\ngospel. It\\'s imperative that you identify those people and get your \\nbrand in front of them. ', 'I mentioned the KPE agency before. They were just what I was \\nlooking for. An interactive marketing and technology consultancy \\non  the  cutting  edge,  KPE had taken  an  early interest  in  the  new \\nspace we were creating. They were a recognized name among For \\ntune 1000 companies known for spotting the newest trends. Hap \\npily, their head of strategy was Matt Ringel, whom I had gotten to \\nknow from  our mutual  interest  in  the  nonprofit  devoted to  pre \\nserving  objects  and  places  of historical  significance,  called \"Save \\nAmerican Treasures.\" \\n\\nI  reached  out  to  Matt  and  proposed  that  he  lead  an  effort to \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c236 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nwrite an article introducing this space to the market. I knew that a \\nwhite  paper  (research  documents  that  consulting  companies  put \\nout on hot topics  of the  day)  introducing us  and the technology \\nfrom an unbiased perspective would be far more effective and lead \\nto more credibility than anything we could do ourselves. I worked ', 'giving  them  examples  from  YaYa,  getting  clients  to  speak  with \\nthem, introducing methodologies and insights that we had gained \\nthrough  our  experience.  I  had  gone  to  analysts  before  this  who \\nwere interested in the space and were now willing to speak to Matt \\nabout what we were doing as well. \\n\\nI was giving KPE another opportunity to look cutting edge and \\ntake a leadership position in the space, while in return, just by dint of \\nthe access I was giving KPE, I bet that YaYa would be the primary \\nexample  in  the  case  study.  Great  things  came  from  the  article, \\nincluding the new name for the space, which we called (thanks to the \\ncreativity of Jane Chen) \"Advergaming.\" The name alone had buzz. \\nOne  lesson  we  learned  from  the  experience  is  that  your  PR \\ncampaign has to be realistic. More often than not, you will have to \\nstart  small.  You\\'ll  be  forced  to  focus  on  your  local  paper,  high \\nschool and college newsletters, or industry trade journals. Or per ', 'site. The point is to light the fire. \\n\\nWhen  the  white  paper  was  completed,  it  received  amazing \\npublicity thanks to KPE\\'s PR engine (which, unlike us, they could \\nafford), and we indeed came out as the instant leader of the space. \\nAs  an  interesting  side  note,  I  subsequently recruited  both  Matt \\nand Jane into YaYa (I wanted the founders of advergaming in my \\norganization). \\n\\nIt  took  less  than  a  year  for  us  to  appear  on  the  cover  of \\nBrandWeek, in the marketplace section of the Wall Street Journal, \\nin the technology section of the New York Times,  in a feature for \\nForbes... the list goes on. I was consistently on every panel with the \\ncompetition (generally I was invited for free while \"the boys\" paid \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cBroadcast Your Brand \\n\\n237 \\n\\nfor the opportunity). While money can certainly be a substitute for \\ngood PR, it\\'s hard to have enough of it to offset the credibility one \\ngets from just one article in Forbes or the New York Times. ', 'The competition, on the other hand, got little press and failed \\nto create a distinct message. It all goes back to your content. Once \\nyou have  it, you  can  begin  to  mold  it  in  a way that will  capture \\nattention.  You  need  to  impart  a  sense  of urgency  and  make  the \\nmessage timely. Reporters continually ask, \"But why is it important \\nNOW?\" If you can\\'t answer that sufficiently, your article will wait. \\nIn  YaYa\\'s  case,  I  highlighted  how  the  games  industry  is  the \\nfastest-growing  segment  of the  entertainment  business  and  how \\nsurprisingly no  one had figured out how to  tap  into  that  growth \\nfor  anything  other  than  pure  fun  and  leisure.  That  isn\\'t  always \\nenough. I had written a piece for the Wall Street Journal\\'s weekly \\ncolumn  called  the  Manager\\'s  Journal.

So I began to rewrite the intros to my piece each week, to ', 'order, the article finally saw the light of day. \\n\\nOnce you light a fire and get the buzz going, you want to  get \\nyour story in  front  of journalists.  The misconception  is  that you \\nhave  to  \"work\"  the  press.  But  overeager  PR  professionals,  who \\ndon\\'t know the  meaning  of \"No,\"  are  working  reporters  hourly. \\nJournalists get fed up with people who are nitwits and pitch arti \\ncles without substance. The media is like any other business. They \\nhave a job to do. If you can help them do their job better, or easier, \\nthey\\'re going to love you. \\n\\nYou have to  start today building relationships with the media \\nbefore you have a story you\\'d like them to write. Send them infor \\nmation. Meet them for coffee. Call regularly to stay in touch. Give \\nthem inside scoops on your industry. Establish yourself as a will \\ning  and  accessible  source  of information,  and  offer  to  be  inter \\nviewed for print, radio, or TV. Never say, \"No comment.\" \\n\\nTo illustrate: I remember the first time I, as the newly minted ', \"www.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c238 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nproject  leader  of Deloitte's  reengineering  efforts,  sat  with  one  of \\nFortune's top journalists, Tom Stewart. My PR firm introduced Tom \\nand me, and I came ready to impress. I had read every piece he had \\nwritten  in  the last five years.  I  playfully gibed him  about  obscure \\npredictions he had made years ago  in other articles, and was pre \\npared to thoughtfully discuss his most recent column. I wanted to \\nbe as useful as possible, giving him access to trends, ideas, and all the \\ncontacts at my disposal. I did the same thing for other journalists at \\nother major newspapers and magazines. \\n\\nTom and I had a blast. Tom's energy and intellectual curiosity \\nwas  contagious.  I  suppose  I  had something to  offer him  as well, \\nbecause he readily took my next lunch offer and the next after that. \\nIt was  more  than just  mutual  admiration.  I  was  prepared  to \\nact, sound, and feel like an expert. When I didn't know something, \\nI was sure to pass him on to the person who did. If you are con \", \"believe you and wonder why you wasted their time. \\n\\nI never did ask Tom for anything in particular. We'd meet a few \\n\\ntimes a year and I'd try to be as helpful as possible. Sure, I remem \\nber the first time I saw one of my ideas in his column months after \\nwe  had  discussed  it,  and  lo  and  behold,  a  competitor  firm  was \\nquoted rather than Deloitte. I went through the roof. My instinct \\nwas  to  call  him  immediately  and  express  my  unhappiness.  But, \\ninstead, I held back and simply invited him for another lunch. \\n\\nIs such a thing too time-consuming? Not if you're convinced it \\nbehooves your company's efforts and if you enjoy the interaction. \\nWhen I was at Deloitte and would show up on TV, I was Deloitte. \\nWhen I was in Forbes, it was the company that reaped the benefits \\nin business development. \\n\\nOver time, the hours you put in developing relationships with \\njournalists will pay off, as it did for me with Tom, both personally \\nand  professionally.  Deloitte's  name  eventually  started  to  pop  up \", \"stories  were  being  heard  by  someone  who  could  retell  them.  I \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cBroadcast Your Brand \\n\\n239 \\n\\nnever asked Tom for an article, but giving him good ideas in our \\nlunches certainly didn't hurt. Today, Tom is the editor-in-chief of \\nthe  Harvard Business Review,  and  I'm  planning  to  take  him  to \\nlunch soon to hear out a few more ideas. Remember, though, you \\ncan't force-feed  or  pressure  a  good journalist. Any attempt to  do \\nso will surely end your professional relationship. The best journal \\nists are almost always also the most ethical. \\n\\nIn traversing the media landscape, be aware that there are also \\nsome land mines. Sometimes what media wants to write, and the \\nstory you think they should write, is a very different thing. \\n\\nI learned this the hard way. One day I got a call from the well-\\nknown  reporter  Hal  Lancaster, who  was  writing  a  column  about \\nmanaging one's career for the Wall Street Journal. The story appeared \\nTuesday, November 19,1996.1 know the exact date because I had \", '\\nWhen Hal called, I was ecstatic. He was a famous reporter for a \\nprestigious newspaper asking about what I did. I was a relative kid \\nat Deloitte. Well, that wasn\\'t exactly the slant of the story, but my \\nexcitement got the best of me. Hal said he was doing a piece on the \\nchanging nature of work. He had a hypothesis that the end of the \\nreengineering  movement  was  having  a  major  impact  on  those \\nwho  had  led  reengineering  projects  and  those  who  had  been \\naffected by the projects. \\n\\nRather than listen more closely to his angle, I tried to impress \\nupon him what I thought the real story was about. Big mistake! If \\na reporter calls you, states his story and the angle he\\'s taking, you \\ncan be sure you\\'ll be used as an example to buttress his angle. Rare \\nis the occasion that a journalist will hear you out and say, \"Oh my \\nGod, you\\'re right! I\\'m going about it all wrong.\" Rarely—I meant \\nnever. But back then, I thought I\\'d set Hal straight. He, however, \\nended up straightening me out. ', 'I took a lot of time with Hal explaining how I had been on the \\nnormal  partner  track  leading  Deloitte\\'s  reengineering  effort, but \\nnow that the trend was ending, I was transitioning into an exciting \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c240 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nspecial project involving marketing. \"I\\'m going to change the way \\ntraditional consulting companies market themselves.\" \\n\\nHe pushed past my excitement. \"Do you feel  displaced in the \\npost-reengineering world?\" he wanted to know. Sure, I conceded, \\nthere was some change involved, but certainly nothing traumatic. \\nHe wanted me to say I felt aimless. But my new gig excited me. I \\nconsidered it a huge step up. \\n\\nThe day the story appeared, I  ran to the newsstand to  get the \\npaper. There, blaring out for everyone to see, was the heading \"A \\ndemotion  does  not  have  to  mean  the  end  of a  fulfilling  career.\" \\nRight above the fold in BIG BOLD letters was my name: \"Mr. Fer-\\nrazzi says the change was difficult, but he has embraced the assign \\nment as an opportunity.\" ', 'He was implying I was demoted! \\nI  got  slammed.  Oh,  and the  ribbing  I  got  from  my boss, Pat \\nLoconto. \"So,  I  heard you were  demoted  and  no  one  reports  to \\nyou. That\\'s terrific! It will save us tons on HR costs, starting with \\nthat raise of yours.\" \\n\\nBe  careful.  Listen  to  the  reporter  when  he  or  she  says,  \"I\\'m \\ndoing a story about displaced workers  ..  .\" No matter what YOU \\nsay, that\\'s the story he\\'ll write. \\n\\nNow that you know a little more about the lay of the land, it\\'s \\ntime to get yourself buzzing. Here\\'s  an  action  plan for creating a \\nPR strategy for Brand You: \\n\\nYou Are Your Own Best PR Representative \\n\\nYou must manage your own media. Public relations companies \\nare facilitators and act as leverage. I\\'ve been  represented for years. \\nThe  best  ones  can  be  strategic  partners,  but  ultimately the  press \\nalways wants to talk to the big guy—you, not a PR rep. Most of the ', \"can help you generate those contacts, but early in your career you \\nwon't need them and you probably won't be able to afford them. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cBroadcast Your Brand \\n\\n241 \\n\\nWho better than you to tell your story with credibility and pas \\nsion? Start making calls to the reporters who cover your industry. \\nHave lunch with  them.  If something  timely occurs  around your \\ncontent,  send  a  press  release.  There's  no  secret  behind  press \\nreleases.  They're  nothing  more  than  two  or  three  paragraphs \\ndescribing what's memorable about your story. It is that easy. \\n\\nRemember,  media  folks  are  just  plain  fun.  They  tend  to  be \\ninteresting and smart, and they're paid to be up to speed on every \\nthing that is going on in the world. And they need you as much as \\nyou need them. They may not need your exact story at the exact \\ntime  you  want,  but  with  a  little  stick-to-itiveness,  they'll  come \\naround. \\n\\nKnow the Media Landscape \\n\\nNothing  infuriates  reporters  and  editors  more, I'm told, than \", 'publication is about or who their audience is. Remember, media is \\na business, and the  companies who  are in the media are looking \\nfor ratings  or to  sell  more  issues.  The  only way they can  do  that \\nwell  is by serving their  specific  audience. \"Listen,  I\\'m  a  devoted \\nreader  of this  magazine,\"  I\\'ll  tell  editors  while  mentioning  a few \\nrecent  articles  I\\'ve  enjoyed. \"I\\'ve  got a  story for you that  I know \\nyour audience will be interested in, as I\\'ve been thinking about it \\nfor a long time.\" That\\'s not a line, either. Before I call journalists, \\nI\\'ll spend time reading their articles, figuring out what they cover, \\nand what kinds of stories their publications like to run. \\n\\nWork the Angles \\n\\nThere are no new stories, it has been said, only old stories told \\nin new ways.  To  make your pitch  sound fresh  and original,  find \\nan  innovative  slant.  What\\'s  your  slant?  Anything  that  screams, \\n\"Now!\" Let\\'s say you\\'re opening a pet store. To a magazine devoted ', \"www.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c242 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nto  entrepreneurs,  perhaps  you  play  up  how  your  store  is  one \\nrecent  example  of the  entrepreneurial  boom  in  the  opening  of \\nlocal  retail  stores.  Suggest  why  this  is  happening  and  what  the \\nmagazine's readers could learn. Selling it to your local newspaper \\nis easy. What caused you to  switch careers? What is  particular to \\nyour  situation  that  highlights  something  going  on  within  your \\ncommunity? And don't forget catalytic moments. Maybe you sell \\na rare animal no one else does.

And a reporter might try to hus \\ntle you off the phone. \\n\\nLearn  to  be  brief—in  both  your  written  and  phone  pitches. \\nBrevity  is  cherished  in  the  media.

They increase \\nawareness, create positive feelings around a company, and play an \\nimportant role in convincing consumers of a product\\'s attractive \\nness.

You\\'ll  get \\nclose to power simply by virtue of reaching out and following the \\nthe advice I have offered in this book. \\n\\nWhen this does inevitably occur for you, there are a few things \\n\\nto keep in mind that I\\'ve learned through the years. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c252 ', \"Never Eat Alone \\n\\nWhile I'm aware of the impact a recognized persona can have \\non  one's  network, and I'm  certainly not shy about putting myself \\nin a place where meeting such people can occur, too much fuss and \\nadoration will kill your efforts before they begin. Folks are folks. \\n\\nThis  came into  play years  ago when  I was  at the  Vanity Fair \\nparty at the old Russian Embassy following the White House Press \\nCorps dinner. When I was standing in line for cocktails, the man \\nbeside  me  seemed  awfully  familiar.  At  first,  I  thought  he  was  a \\npolitician. Then I placed his face as someone who was involved in \\npolitics, but behind the scenes in some manner, one of the Presi \\ndent's key advisors. \\n\\nI  was  right—sort  of.  The  man  was  Richard  Schiff,  the  actor \\nwho played the communications advisor to the fictional president \\nplayed by Martin Sheen in The West Wing. Out of context, I'm ter \\nrible with recognizing TV stars. \\n\\nJust as  casually as  if he were  someone  I  didn't know at  all, I \", 'before engaging with someone they don\\'t know, and politely said \\nhello without  introducing himself. \\n\\n\"And you are?\" I asked. When he realized I didn\\'t know who he \\nwas immediately, he opened up. We ultimately exchanged e-mails \\nand stayed in touch. \\n\\nI\\'ve  found  that  trust  is  the  essential  element  of mixing  with \\npowerful  and  famous  people—trust  that you\\'ll  be  discreet;  trust \\nthat  you  have  no  ulterior  motives  behind  your  approach;  trust \\nthat you\\'ll deal with them as people and not as stars; and basically \\ntrust that you feel like a peer who deserves to be engaged as such. \\nThe first few moments of an encounter is the litmus test for such \\na person to size up whether he or she can trust you in these ways \\nor not. \\n\\nThe irony of celebrities is that they often have very fragile egos. \\nIn  many  cases,  something  in  them  drove  them  to  want  to  be \\nfamous.

However much the world opens up to celebrities, a \\npart of it also closes. There is a loss of privacy. And because they \\nlive in a world of adulation, celebrities struggle every day balanc \\ning their private and public personas. They often fret over the fact \\nthat  their  public  persona  becomes  indistinguishable  from  their \\nprivate  personality.  They feel  misunderstood  and  underappreci \\nated for who they really are. \\n\\nTo  assure them that you're interested in them for themselves, \\nrather than what the public perceives them to be, stay away from \\ntheir fame and focus, instead, on their interests. You can certainly \\nlet them know that you respect their work, but don't dwell.  Take \\nthem away from what they are normally barraged with. \\n\\nUnfortunately,  sometimes  we  make  inappropriate  exceptions \\nwhen talking to exceptional people. You simply have to watch and \\nlisten  with  your  heart  as  well  as  with  your  eyes.  Find  out  what \\ntheir passions are. \\n\\nNot long  ago,  I  saw the  then-Governor  of Vermont, Howard \", \"were joking about this unknown governor of this small state and \\nhis  crazy aspirations  to  become  President.  The  next  time  I  saw \\nhim  speak was  at a nonprofit event for human  rights  in D.C. By \\nnow, he was indeed running for President, although no one took \\nhim seriously. \\n\\nIntrigued  by Dean  and his  message,  I  approached  one  of the \\npeople in his campaign staff (which, at the time, was one campaign \\naide  and  a  state  trooper).  I  told  the  aide  that  I  was  a  politically \\nactive fellow Yale  alum who was  interested in meeting the  presi \\ndential hopeful at some point. The aide and I had a good talk and \\nI did talk briefly with Dean, as did many other folks at the event. \\n\\nTwo weeks later, there Dean was again at the Gill Foundation's \\nannual meeting in California, preparing to deliver the same talk I \\nhad heard a couple weeks before. It would be the third time I saw \\nhim  speak  on  essentially  the  same  subject,  and  I  had  some \", 'www.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c254 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nthoughts  on  how he  might  deliver  his  speech  more  forcefully.  I \\ncaught the attention of his aide and asked if I could get a second \\nwith the governor. We found him near the podium where he was \\npreparing minutes before he was to go on stage. I told him that I \\nhad seen his talk on a number of occasions, I had spoken with his \\naide,  and  I  had  some  ideas  for  how he  could  deliver  his  speech \\nwith  more  impact.  I  suggested  that  he  emphasize  a  few  points \\nhere, play down a few points there, and cut down the length. Yes, I \\nwas taking some risk, but what did I have to lose? And I was very \\nsincere  in  my suggestions.  I  cared  about  his  message  on  human \\nrights and wanted him to get it across powerfully. \\n\\nAs  I  sat  in  the  audience,  I  heard  one  recommendation  after \\nanother  come  to  life  in  his  speech.  Holy cow!  The  Governor  of ', 'still a really long shot) was taking my advice. After his talk, I told \\nhim how impressive the talk was and that I wanted to devote the \\nrest of the event to introducing him to all the movers and shakers \\n(read: big donors) within the Gill Foundation. \\n\\nMonths later, when I  saw the governor again  at a fundraising \\ndinner party at the director Rob Reiner\\'s home, he was no longer \\nan obscure candidate but a popular maverick setting the tone for \\nthe  entire  Democratic  nomination.  Someone  introduced  the \\ntwo  of  us.  \"Governor,  do  you  know  Keith  Ferrazzi?\"  Governor \\nDean replied, \"Of course I know Keith. He\\'s one of the main peo \\nple responsible for me getting the traction that made such a differ \\nence in the early days.\" And I truly felt at that moment that I had \\nmade a difference. \\n\\nJust remember that famous  and powerful  people are first and \\nforemost people: They\\'re proud, sad, insecure, hopeful, and if you \\ncan help them achieve their goals, in whatever capacity, they will \\nbe appreciative.

If you want \\nto  meet  the  movers  and  shakers  directly,  you have  to  become  a \\njoiner. It's amazing how accessible people are when we meet them \\nat events that speak to their interests. \\n\\nHere are a few more places that I've found particularly reward \\ning when looking to find people on the rise  or who have already \\nrisen: \\n\\nYoung Presidents' Organization (YPO) \\n\\nThis  organization  is  for  executive managers  under the  age  of \\nforty-four  and  has  regional  chapters  across  the  United  States.  If \\nyou're running a business, or want to, there are plenty of entrepre \\nneurial  organizations  that  will  put  you  in  front  of the  corporate \\nchieftains of tomorrow. Similar professional organizations exist for \\nthe  entire  range  of vocational  pursuits.

There  is  strength  in numbers,  and when you join \\nsuch a group, and become a central figure in that group's activities, \\nyou'll become someone whom other powerful  people will  seek to \\ndeal with. \\n\\nPolitical  Fundraisers \\n\\nAlthough  I  once  ran  for  office  as  a  Republican,  I  no  longer \\nopenly discuss my political affiliation. Why?  First, because I now \\nvote the person and the issues, not the party. Also so I have access \\nto those who are making a difference in both parties. I try and do \\nthree  to  ten  fundraisers  at  my home  each  year,  supporting  both \\nregional and national politicians who I believe will make a posi \\ntive difference from both sides of the aisle. Politics is the nexus of \\nmoney, passion, and power. In politics, the unknown person you \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c256 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nhelp today is the political heavy that can help you tomorrow. Join \\na local campaign.

If you  develop  a  side  expertise  or  passion,  as  I've  sug \\ngested  earlier,  you  can  find  out  which  well-known  people  share \\nyour  interest  and  attend  the  conferences  that  these  people  will \\nlikely attend. Spirituality in leadership  and human rights are two \\npassions  of mine;  I  try  to  participate  by  being  active  in  several \\norganizations and speaking at several conferences a year.

What does \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cGetting Close to Power \\n\\n257 \\n\\nmatter is  the  skill you have  and the  camaraderie you  can  create. \\nThere's  something  about  athletics  that  gets  people  to  put  down \\ntheir guard. Maybe competition of this  sort taps  into  our psyche \\nin a certain way that brings us back to a more innocent time when \\nwe were kids throwing a ball around on the street. Or maybe it's \\nthe  venue  itself—away from  the  office,  on  a  squash  court  or the \\nrolling green hills of a golf course. \\n\\nAh, golf.

It should never appear to any \\none that you are trying to cash in on relationships or your mem \\nbership in the club. At some clubs, to so much as hint at a future \\nbusiness deal on the course is a breach of etiquette; at others, you \\ncan be rather blatant about it. You'll need to feel that out. But most \\navid  golfers  will  admit  that  the  game  has  opened  up  countless \\nopportunities.  They do,  ultimately,  get  to  do  business  with  one \\nanother—even  if  it's  on  the  nineteenth  hole,  at  the  bar,  over \\ndrinks.

Like  the \", \"famous comedian, I, too, had no interest in belonging to any \\n\\nclub that would have me as a member. \\n\\nIt  certainly  wasn't  because  of  some  misplaced  belief  in  self-\\nsufficiency:  I knew then how invaluable and rewarding a gather \\ning of people could be. You wouldn't hear any angry grumblings \\nout  of my  mouth  about  not  having  enough  time.  (That  excuse \\nkills  me—what  could  be  more  important  than  meeting  like-\\nminded professionals?) And I certainly wasn't shy in large crowds. \\nIt's  just  that  all  the  clubs  that  seemed  worth  attending \\nhad  their  doors  closed  to  a  young,  relatively  unconnected  man \\nlike me. \\n\\nThese clubs and conferences, with their selective memberships \\nand aura of power, exist for good reason:  People are always hun \\ngry to congregate with other people with similar interests, to make \\na  difference  in their communities,  and to  create  an  environment \\nthat makes it easier to do business.

He sold TED for $14 million  in  2001, and is now \\nbusy running a new conference called TEDmed, about the conver \\ngence of technology and health, which I highly recommend. \\n\\nI tried to do something similar when, as a fresh-faced MBA, I \\nmoved to  Chicago after taking a job with Deloitte. I barely knew \\nanyone in the city. The first thing I did was ask people to introduce \\nme  to  their  friends  in  Chicago.  As  I  met  with  the  people  my \\nfriends had suggested, I began to inquire what boards I could join \\nto get more involved in the life of the city.

I  didn\\'t just \\nwant to host wine-tastings at a twenty-something dating mixer. \\n\\nAt a time like this, you have to figure out what is your U.S.P.— \\n\"unique  selling  proposition,\"  for  all  you  non-MBA  types  out \\nthere.

Like most clubs, it starts with your group of friends, who \\nthen select their own friends. Over time, those people will bring in \\neven more new and intriguing people. \\n\\nThis  is  an  enormously  successful  model  that  even  thriving \\nbusinesses  have  built  upon.  Think  about  the  successful  Internet \\nsites  that  pooled  people  together  around  a  common  proposi \\ntion—like  political  affiliation,  gardening,  or  even,  in  the  case  of \\niVillage, being a woman—and built profitable enterprises  on the \\nfeeling  of belonging  to  that  community.

In Illinois, I thought \\nI  could  create  a  similar  nonprofit  organization  for local  compa \\nnies.  With  a  federal  program  already  in  the  works,  I  figured  it \\nwould not be too  difficult to find others with  a similar interest— \\njudges and other members of the national organization who lived \\nin Chicago, consultants, and employees of big corporations whose \\njob it was to deal with TQM. \\n\\nThe first thing I needed to do was enlist the support of an insti \", \"bers.

With  Dick's  backing,  Governor  Jim \\nEdgar  gladly  assigned  his  Lieutenant  Governor  to  our board.  In \\nlanding the support of these three people, our start-up  organiza \\ntion got a big dose of credibility. Soon a whole host of people was \\nwilling to be part of the enterprise, including the leaders of TQM \\nat Amoco and Rush Presbyterian Hospital, who also brought their \\nCEOs  on board. The kicker:  Because I had started the organiza \\ntion, I was  president!  Of course, now we had to  create, run, and \\nfinance  this enterprise. But the hard part was now done. We were \\na  credible  institution,  and  from  here  we  all  just  rolled  up  our \", \"\\nThus  was  born  The  Lincoln  Award  for  Business  Excellence \\n(ABE).

Two  years  after  I  started  it,  I \\nknew every major CEO in Chicago on a first-name basis. \\n\\nThe lesson? Even a Harvard MBA or an invitation to Davos is \\nno  substitute for personal  initiative.

Organize your own.\" \\n\\nThe  business  term  networking,  as  it  happens,  joined  the  English  lan ', \"guage  in  1966.  But  more  than  two  centuries  earlier,  in  Philadel \\n\\nphia,  a  young  Benjamin  Franklin  used  this  sweet  social  science  to \\n\\nbecome  one  of the  most influential  men  in  our as-yet-untitled  nation. \\n\\nBefore  he  became  a  revered  patriot,  statesman,  and  inventor,  he \\n\\nwas  one  of  America's  most  successful  businessmen,  rising  from \\n\\nindentured  servant  to  printing  tycoon. \\n\\nFlip your calendars,  if you  will,  back to  1 7 2 3,  at which  time  the \\n\\nseventeen-year-old  Franklin  was  neither  wealthy  nor  accomplished. \\n\\nHe  was  an  aspiring  entrepreneur—trained  in  the  printing  trade  by \\n\\nhis  brother James—and  a  fresh  face  in  Philadelphia,  having  moved \\n\\nthere  after  failing  to  find  work  in  New York.  Knowing  no  one  in  his \\n\\nnew  town,  but  eager  to  start  his  own  print  shop,  Franklin  began  to \", \"flex  his  connecting  mojo. \\n\\nWithin  seven  months,  Franklin—who'd  landed  a  job  in  an  estab \\n\\nlished  print  shop—made  the  acquaintance  of  Pennsylvania  Gover \\n\\nnor  William  Keith.  The  governor  encouraged  young  Franklin  to \\n\\ntravel  to  London  to  buy  whatever  equipment  he'd  need  to  start  his \\n\\nown  press.  Keith  even  promised  letters  of reference  and  credit,  both \\n\\nof which  Franklin would  need  to  purchase a  printing  press and  type. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cBuild It and They Will Come \\n\\n265 \\n\\nBut  upon  reaching  London,  Franklin  found  that  Keith  had  not fur \\n\\nnished  these  letters.  Franklin  spent  the  next  two  years  earning \\n\\nenough  money  to  simply  sail  back  to  America.  On  his  return  voy \\n\\nage,  Franklin  again  displayed  his  networking  virtuosity:  His  first \\n\\njob,  back  in  Philadelphia,  was  as  a  clerk  in  the  store  of  Thomas \", 'Denham,  a  fellow  passenger  on  his  trans-Atlantic  voyage. \\n\\nBefore  long,  Franklin  was  back  in  the  print  trade,  employed  in \\n\\nthe  same  established  print shop  as  before.  In  the  interest of  intellec \\n\\ntual  stimulation  and  his  own  self-advancement,  Franklin  organized \\n\\na  dozen  of  his  friends  into  a  Friday  night  social  group  called  the \\n\\n\"Junto\"—described,  as  follows,  in  The Autobiography. \\n\\nThe  rules  that  I  drew  up  required  that  every  member,  in  his \\n\\nturn,  should  produce  one  or  more  queries  on  any  point  of \\n\\nMorals,  Politics,  or  Natural  Philosophy  [physics],  to  be  dis-\\n\\ncuss\\'d  by  the  company;  and  once  in  three  months  produce \\n\\nand  read  an  essay  of  his  own  writing,  on  any  subject  he ', \"pleased. \\n\\nThe  members  of the Junto were young  men  not yet respectable  or \\n\\nestablished  enough  to  break  into  the  clubs  that  served  Philadel \\n\\nphia's  business  elite.  Like  Franklin,  they were  tradesmen,  common \\n\\npeople.  No  doubt  about  it—the  man  loved  clubs.  Indeed,  in  addi \\n\\ntion  to  its  lessons  of  thrift,  industry,  and  prudence,  Franklin's  auto \\n\\nbiography  tells  us  every  man  should  be  part  of  a  social  group,  if \\n\\nnot  three.  He  believed  that  a  group  of  like-minded,  achievement-\\n\\noriented  individuals  could  dramatically  leverage  each  other's  suc \\n\\ncess  to  do  things  otherwise  impossible. \\n\\nNow  flash  those  calendars  forward, \\n\\nif  you  can, \\n\\nto  1 7 3 1. \\n\\nFranklin,  having  earned  enough \\n\\nto  start  his  own  print  shop, \\n\\ninvested  in  a  small  failing  newspaper,  the  Pennsylvania  Gazette. \", \"Through  snappy content  and  graphics  (much  of  it written  or  drawn \\n\\nby  Franklin  himself)  and  daring  distribution,  Franklin  turned  the \\n\\nGazette  into  a  profitable  vehicle  with  the  largest  circulation  in  the \\n\\ncolonies.  The  newspaper's  prosperity  transformed  Franklin  into  an \\n\\neighteenth-century  media  magnate.  Franklin  gained  enough \\n\\nrenown—and  money—to  apply  himself  to  public  projects,  the  first \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c266 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nof which  was  the  establishment  of  the  Library  Company  of  Philadel \\n\\nphia,  the first circulating  library in  North  America  (still  in  existence). \\n\\nIt was  the  library campaign—the  first  of  Franklin's  several  public \\n\\nprojects  for  Philadelphia—that  gave  Franklin  a  deep  insight  into \\n\\none  of  the  crown  virtues  of  networking.  The  resistance  he  encoun \\n\\ntered,  he tells  us: \\n\\n[M]ade  me soon  feel  the  Impropriety of presenting  one's self \", 'as  the  Proposer  of any useful  Project that might be  suppos\\'d  to \\n\\nraise  one\\'s  Reputation  in  the  smallest  degree  above  that  of \\n\\none\\'s  Neighbors,  when  one  has  need  of  their  Assistance  to \\n\\naccomplish  that  Project.  I  therefore  put  my  self  as  much  as  I \\n\\ncould  out  of  sight,  and  stated  it  as  a  Scheme  of  a  Number  of \\n\\nFriends,  who  had  requested  me  to  go  about and  propose  it to \\n\\nsuch  as  they  thought  Lovers  of  Reading.  In  this  way  my Affair \\n\\nwent  on  more  smoothly,  and  I  ever  after  practis\\'d  it  on  such \\n\\nOccasions. \\n\\nAnd,  oh,  would  there  be  \"Occasions.\"  Following  the  library  in \\n\\n1731—for  which  the  Junto  helped  Franklin  find  his  first  fifty  sub \\n\\nscribers—there  came  Philadelphia\\'s  city  watch  (1735);  its  first  fire ', \"company  (1736);  its  first  college,  which  would  two  years  later \\n\\nbecome  the  University  of  Pennsylvania  (1749);  its  first—and  also \\n\\nthe  colonies'  first  hospital,  through  a  mixture  of  public  and  private \\n\\nfunding \\n\\n(1751);  and \\n\\nits \\n\\nfirst  fire \\n\\ninsurance  company  (1751). \\n\\nFranklin  also  organized  Pennsylvania's first volunteer  militia  (1 747) \\n\\nand \\n\\nintroduced  a  program  of  paving, \\n\\nlighting,  and  cleaning \\n\\nPhiladelphia's  streets  (1756).  Each  project  depended  upon  the \\n\\nassistance  of  Franklin's  network  of  personal  and  professional  con \\n\\nnections,  and  with  each  project  his  network  grew,  along  with  his \\n\\nreputation  as  a  doer  of  good. \\n\\nFranklin  died  in  April  1790,  about  one year  into  George  Wash \\n\\nington's  first  term.  More  than  2 0 , 0 00  Americans  attended  his \", \"funeral. \\n\\nWith  networking,  as  in  so  much  else,  we  follow  a  trail  that \\nFranklin blazed.

It wasn't long before a \\nreporter from the New York Times showed up to write an article. \", \"me with one of the more painful and useful lessons of my life. For \\nI had angered William F. Buckley Jr., the famous Yale alum known \\nfor  founding  the  conservative  magazine  National  Review  and \\nauthoring dozens of books. \\n\\nI ran for office as a Republican. The Republicans needed a can \\ndidate, and at Yale, they were the minority as opposed to the many \\nlimousine liberals who  seemed to  a  steelworking kid from  Pitts \\nburgh insincere and unthinking. Anyway, I was a youngster, and I \\nwas still exploring my political sensibilities. I probably also had a \\ncertain  affinity for  the  traditionalism  of the  moderate  conserva \\ntive party on campus called the Tories and a real fondness for their \\nparties and the commitment of their leadership and alumni. \\n\\nBut this story is not about politics. It's about pride and ego. \\nBack then,  I  hadn't yet realized that my upbringing  could be \\na well of strength rather than weakness. Insecurity drove me to act \\nin ways I wish I hadn't. My leadership style, for instance, was far \\nfrom  inclusive.  While  I  was  racking  up  accomplishments,  my \", 'awards  and failed to recognize those who had helped make them \\npossible. Too  much hubris  and not enough  humility, as my dad \\nmight say, though not in so many words. \\n\\nI was  showing all those kids whom  I had caddied for back at \\n\\nthe club that I was just as good as they were. \\n\\nI lost the election, as you know, but the New York Times article \\nhad  been  read  by  quite  a  number  of people,  and  by  a  few who \\nthought being a Republican at Yale was a good thing. In my mail \\nbox, weeks after the election, I received a short note. \\n\\n\"So happy to see that there is at least one Republican at Yale. \\n\\nCome see me sometime.

I became an instant celebrity in our small circle. \\n\\nOf course, the man had issued an invitation and I, for one, was \\ngoing to take him up on the offer. I immediately set about contact \\ning Mr. Buckley to set a date for a meeting. He graciously invited ', \"\\nA  few  months  later,  with  three  other  classmates  in  tow,  I \\narrived  at  a  Connecticut train  station where we were  greeted by \\nnone other than Mr. Buckley himself in an old pair of khakis and \\na wrinkled button-down shirt. He drove us to his home, where we \\nmet his wife, who was gardening at the time. It was a glorious day. \\nWe  shared  a  few  glasses  of  wine,  talked  politics,  Mr.  Buckley \\nplayed  the  harpsichord,  and  then  we  all  sat  down  for  a lengthy \\nlunch. Afterward, we were invited to  take  a  dip  in  the  Buckleys' \\nbeautiful pool with tile mosaics reminiscent of a Roman bath. \\n\\nI couldn't let the opportunity pass. Mr. Buckley wasn't the only \\nYale alum dissatisfied with the political climate at his alma mater. \\nOther conservative alumni were complaining. Many stopped giv \\ning money to Yale outright. I thought I had a solution that would \\nbe a real win-win for the campus and for these alums. \", 'What if, I suggested, we create a foundation that allowed dis \\nenfranchised conservative alums the ability to give money directly \\nto  the  undergraduate  organizations  that  represented  the  tradi \\ntional values they supported? Yale wins because it would be get \\nting money that it otherwise wouldn\\'t.  Conservative alumni win \\nbecause  they  could  again  feel  good  about  their  school  and  their \\nability to make a contribution. Students win because there would \\nbe  more  organizational  diversity  and  money  for  campus  clubs. \\nWhat could be better? \\n\\nWell, I made the pitch and I thought Mr. Buckley embraced the \\nidea. He told me that he had started a foundation to  fund a stu \\ndent publication a few years before that had never quite got off the \\nground. There was, he said, still money in the foundation, and he \\nwould be happy to put it toward my idea. That is, at least, what I \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cNever Give in to Hubris \\n\\n271 \\n\\nheard.

I \\nmade sure everyone knew that I was the new president of a brand-\\nspankin\\'-new organization. Boy, wasn\\'t I cool? I started searching \\nout other alumni who  might be interested in contributing to the \\ncause. I hit the phones, and on weekends, I\\'d go to New York to \\npitch other alumni on the new foundation that William F. Buckley \\nand I were starting. \\n\\n\"Bill Buckley put in some money. Would you also like to help \\nout?\" I\\'d  ask them. And they did.  On  each return  trip  from New \\nYork, my head got bigger and bigger as I reveled in the famous and \\npowerful  people  that  were  giving  me  (note  the  use  of \"me,\"  not \\n\"us\") money. \\n\\nMy poor classmates had to suffer my telling stories of my latest \\nescapade to New York. Then, as quickly as it started, my ever-so-\\nbrief brush with fame came to a screeching halt. ', 'As luck would have it, Mr. Buckley found himself one day in an \\nelevator  with  one  of the  other  famous  alums  who  had  pledged \\nmoney. \"Bill,\" this  gentleman said, \"I matched your contribution \\nto this new foundation at Yale.\" To which Bill replied, \"What foun \\ndation?\" \\n\\nIt turned out that Mr. Buckley did not recall our conversation. \\nOr maybe he told me one thing and I heard something quite differ \\nent. Maybe he just thought I wanted to rekindle the magazine. But \\nby then, it was irrelevant. Mr. Buckley could recall only his stalled \\nmagazine and a vague reference to restarting it at Yale. He told the \\nother donor he was not the cofounder of a new conservative foun \\ndation  at Yale,  which  I\\'m  sure  was  the  way he  saw  it.  At  which \\npoint, everything unraveled. \\n\\nThe  pledges  I  had  received needed to  go  unrealized,  as there \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c272 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nwas no repository for them any longer. Mr. Buckley didn\\'t return ', \"present and equally excited that day at Mr. Buckley's didn't come \\nto  my  rescue  when  I  pleaded  for  them  to  explain  that  they had \\nheard exactly what I had heard. My reputation had been tarnished \\namong  some  important  people.  I  was  embarrassed  among  my \\nfriends after I had been gloating. And then to add rock salt to the \\nwound, someone  at Yale's  college newspaper got wind of all that \\nhad happened and created an illustration depicting me as getting \\nwounded  by  large,  famous  names  being  dropped  from  the  sky. \\nOuch, indeed, and I deserved it. \\n\\nLooking back now, I'm appreciative of the experience. I learned \\nsome  valuable  lessons.  For  one,  I  had  to  begin  the  journey  to \\nchange my leadership  style.  It wasn't  enough  to  get things  done. \\nYou had to  get things done and make the people around you feel \\ninvolved, and not just part of the process but part of the leadership. \\nI  learned that  commitments  weren't  commitments  unless  every \", \"learned how truly small  the world  is,  especially the world  of the \\nrich and powerful. \\n\\nMost important, I learned that arrogance is a disease that can \\nbetray you  into  forgetting  your  real  friends  and  why  they're  so \\nimportant. Even with the best of intentions, too much hubris will \\nstir up other people's ire and their desire to put you in your place. \\nSo  remember,  in  your  hike  up  the  mountain,  be  humble.

Successful  people  in  nearly  every  field \\nknow that they can't be their best unless they have a good coach in \\ntheir corner. And now the business world knows it, too: In a fast-\\npaced, fluid, and dynamic environment, where flattened organiza \\ntions made up  of cross-functional teams must respond rapidly to \\nchange, mentoring is one of the most effective strategies to get the \\nbest out of each and every individual. \\n\\nMany companies have developed formal mentoring programs \\nwith the idea that sharing what you know and learning what oth \\ners have to teach is just smart management. At FerrazziGreenlight, \\nwe have worked with many companies to create such formal pro \\ngrams with the idea that helping employees build relationships for \\ncareer  success  reduces  turnover  and  ultimately leads  to  stronger \\nexternal relationships for revenue growth as well. One of the more \\nhistorically successful programs was established in  1997 at one of \\nIntel's largest chip-making facilities in New Mexico. \", \"The people responsible for developing that program wanted to \\ngo  beyond  the  traditional  notion  of  mentoring  as  a  one-way \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c274 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nprocess that teamed seasoned executives with  ambitious up-and-\\ncomers.  To  the  people  at  Intel,  organization-wide  mentoring \\nmeant  creating  an  inclusive  learning  network  matching  people \\nnot  by job  title  or  by  seniority but  by  specific  skills  that  are  in \\ndemand.  The  company uses  an  intranet site  and e-mail to  break \\ndown departmental barriers and create partnerships between two \\npeople who can teach each other different valuable skills that they \\nneed to  be  better  employees.  The  system  enables  Intel  to  spread \\nbest  practices  quickly  throughout  the  global  organization  and \\ndevelop the best and brightest employees in the industry. \\n\\nWhile it's wonderful the business world is finally catching on, \\nmentoring—a lifelong process of giving and receiving in a never-\\nending role as both master and apprentice—has  always been the \\nHoly Grail for those who love to connect people with people. \", 'No process in history has done more to facilitate the exchange \\nof  information,  skills,  wisdom,  and  contacts  than  mentoring. \\nYoung men and women learned their trade by studying as appren \\ntices  under  their  respective  craftsmen.  Young  artists  developed \\ntheir individual style only after years working under elder masters. \\nNew priests apprenticed for a decade or more with older priests to \\nbecome wise  religious  men  themselves.  When finally these  men \\nand women embarked on their own, they had the knowledge and \\nthe connections to succeed in their chosen  field. \\n\\nBy studying the lives of those who know more than we do, we \\nexpand our horizons. As a child, I realized that many of the oppor \\ntunities other kids had that would expose them to new things and \\nnew people, like summer camp or extra tutoring, were unavailable \\nto me. I quickly learned that success in my life would require deter \\nmination, exploration, self-reliance, and a strong will. I also learned \\nto rely on other people who were available: my father and some of \\nthe more professional people he knew in our neighborhood. \\n\\nMy mom and dad instructed me to observe how the most suc ', '\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cFind Mentors, Find Mentees, Repeat \\n\\n275 \\n\\ntold me I  could learn how to live my life by watching others  live \\ntheir lives.

He gave me \\nthe confidence I needed to go out, without pride or insecurity, and \\ndevelop  relationships  with  the  men  and women  he knew whom \\nhe respected. \\n\\nPerhaps  the  value  he  placed  on  mentors  came  from  Damon \\nRunyon,  one  of my  father\\'s  favorite  authors.  A  tough  guy who \\ndropped  out  of school  by the  sixth  grade  and  bootstrapped  his \\nway to  success, Runyon\\'s  tough-luck stories  about  equally tough \\ncharacters  had  a  lot  of  emotional  resonance  for  my  dad.  His \\nfavorite  quote  of  Runyon\\'s  was  \"Always  try  to  rub  up  against ', 'may rub  off on you.\" No  surprise,  then, that my dad wanted me \\nrubbing  up  against  people  with  more  money,  more  knowledge, \\nand more skills than he had. \\n\\nBefore I was even ten years old, I remember him encouraging me \\nto bike down our dusty driveway to hang out with our neighbors. By \\nthe time I was in grade school, I had reached out to George Love, the \\nfather of one of my friends and a local attorney. Dad would take me \\nto see Walt Saling, a stockbroker, every so often just to visit. I\\'d sit \\nclose  by  and  pepper  Walt  with  questions  about  his  job  and  the \\npeople he worked with.

He  wanted  me  to  be \\ncomfortable  with  older,  more  experienced  people  and  to  never \\nfear  seeking  their help  or  asking  them  questions. When  my dad \\nwould  show  up  with  me  in  tow  on  a  Friday  night,  his  buddies \\nwould say, \"Here\\'s Pete  [my father\\'s name]  and Re-Pete  [my nick \\nname to his buddies].\" \\n\\nI look back on those times with  so much  gratitude and emo \\ntion. At every turn, and to this very day, I still try to connect with \\ntrailblazers,  head  honchos,  and  people  who  have  experienced  a \\ndifferent life than I\\'ve had. \\n\\nMy father and Runyon were onto something in a way, perhaps, ', 'backs  up  their  belief that  whom  you  associate  with  is  crucial  to \\nwho  you  become.  Dr.  David  McClelland  of  Harvard  University \\nresearched the qualities and characteristics of high achievers in our \\nsociety.

In other words, if you hang \\nwith connected people, you\\'re connected. If you hang with success \\nful people, you\\'re more likely to become successful yourself. \\n\\nLet  me  explain  how  important  mentoring  became  for  me \\nthrough an experience I had early on in my career. It was toward \\nthe end of the summer before my second year at business school. \\nDeloitte  and  Touche,  the  accounting  and  consulting  firm  I  had \\nbeen  interning  with  during  that  summer, was  having  its  annual \\nend-of-the-summer cocktail  party for its  interns  from  all  around \\nthe country. \\n\\nOff to the corner, amid all the clink of drinks and polite chatter, I ', 'gruff, white-haired guy who was holding court. Other interns stayed \\nin  their  comfortable  cliques,  keeping  their  distance  from  their \\nbosses, but I headed straight for the poobahs. It was, really, no differ \\nent from riding my bike down the road to see the neighbors. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cFind Mentors, Find Mentees, Repeat \\n\\n277 \\n\\nI went  straight up  to the man  in the  center of all this  action, \\n\\nintroduced myself, and asked him point blank, \"Who are you?\" \\n\\n\"I\\'m the CEO of this firm,\" he said with an abruptness that sig \\nnaled  I  should have known that, while the  partners  around him \\nsmiled and chuckled mischievously. \\n\\nHe  was  about  six-foot-three,  barrel-chested,  and  very,  very \\ndirect. He\\'s the kind of guy who just fills the room with his presence. \\n\\n\"Well, I guess I should have known that,\" I responded. \\n\"Yeah, I guess you should have,\" he said. He was joking, and as \\nis  often  the  case with  people  in  positions  of power, he liked my ', '\"Loconto,\" I said. \"That\\'s a good Jewish name, isn\\'t it?\" \\nHe laughed, and I talked with him in the little Italian that he \\nand  I knew.  In  short order, we were fully engaged, talking about \\nour families and our similar upbringing. His dad was also a  first-\\ngeneration  Italian-American  who  instilled  in  him  many  of  the \\nsame values my father had taught me. I did, in fact, know Pat, but \\nonly  by  reputation.  I  had  heard  about  his  no-nonsense  style— \\ntough and tireless but warmhearted, too. I decided then and there \\nthat getting to know him better might not be a bad idea. \\n\\nThat  I  approached  him  at  the  cocktail  party  and  discovered \\nwe were cut from similar cloth  deepened my respect for the man \\nand  his  respect  for  me.  I  found  out  later  that  quickly  after  that \\nexchange, he followed up and found out everything about me and \\nmy summer with the firm. That night I hung out with Pat and the \\nsenior partners into the wee hours of the morning. I didn\\'t try to ', \"than I did. Many people believe that's what it takes when reaching \\nout to those above you, but in truth that often results in making a \\njerk out  of yourself. \\n\\nI remembered that my father and mother had told me to speak \\nless in such situations; the less you say, the more you'll likely hear. \\nThey were warning me, given my predisposition for dominating a \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c278 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nconversation from an early age. That's the way you learn from oth \\ners, Dad said, and glean the small nuances that will help you engen \\nder  a  deeper  relationship  later  on.  There's  also  no  better  way to \\nsignal  your  interest  in  becoming  a  mentee.  People  tacitly notice \\nyour respect and are flattered by the attention. That said, quiet for \\nme isn't exactly quiet.  I  asked tons  of questions,  suggested things \\nthat I saw from the summer, and conspired with these leaders of the \\nfirm on what was important to them—making the firm a success. \\nMentoring is a very deliberate activity that requires  people to \", 'ple\\'s  success,  and  consciously  strive  to  build  beneficial  relation \\nships whenever the opportunity arises. Other interns at that party \\nlooked at Pat and the other senior partners with intimidation and \\nboredom  (What do I have in common with them?)  and therefore \\nkept their distance.  They looked at their job titles versus the big \\nwigs\\' and felt excluded, and because of it, they were. \\n\\nWhen I finally graduated from school, in typical MBA fashion, \\nI  interviewed  with  several  companies.  My  choice  was  coming \\ndown  to  Deloitte  Consulting  and  one  of their  competitors, Mc-\\nKinsey. McKinsey was then considered the gold standard of con \\nsulting companies. For most of my peers, the  choice would have \\nbeen obvious. \\n\\nThen, one  afternoon, I  got a call the  day before my final Mc \\nKinsey interview. When I picked up the phone, I was met with a \\nfamiliar  gruff  voice.  \"Accept  our  offer  now  and  you  can  come \\ndown to New York for dinner this  evening with me and some of ', 'Loconto. I want to know if you\\'re coming to Deloitte or not?\" \\n\\nI  told Pat,  uncomfortably, that  I  hadn\\'t decided  on where  I\\'d \\nend up. But I had an idea that might help me through the process. \\n\"Listen, I\\'m still up in the air,\" I told him. \"But it would help if I \\nhad  dinner  with  you  and  a  few  partners  to  get  a  better  feel  for \\nwhat I\\'d be doing and where the organization is headed.\" \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cFind Mentors, Find Mentees, Repeat \\n\\n279 \\n\\n\"I\\'ll have dinner with you only if you accept my offer,\" he said. \\nPat was joking again, and I liked him even more for his unortho \\ndox recruiting practices. Then he let me off the hook with, \"OK, \\nget your butt  down  to  New York,  and  don\\'t worry, we\\'ll  get you \\nout to Chicago in the morning for your interview.\" Now, how did \\nhe know about my interview? \\n\\nSo I found myself with Pat and a few partners around a table at ', 'was hard  and heavy,  as was  the  drinking. We had gone  through \\nbottles and bottles of great wine and a few cognacs on top of that. \\nNear  the  end  of  dinner,  Pat  threw  out  his  pitch  and  actually \\nlaunched into a fairly shocking tirade. \\n\\n\"Who the hell do you think you are? You think McKinsey gives \\na damn about Keith  Ferrazzi?\" Before I  could answer, he  contin \\nued. \"You think the CEO  of McKinsey knows who you are? You \\nthink any of the senior partners would take a Sunday night to have \\ndinner with you? You\\'ll be just another number-crunching MBA \\ngrad lost in the shuffle. We care about you. We want you to be suc \\ncessful  here.  More  importantly, we  think you  can make  a  differ \\nence in our firm.\" \\n\\nWas I in? Pat demanded to know. \\nWow, his pitch was compelling, and right then my instinct told \\nme he was right. I knew he was right. But I wasn\\'t about to leave \\nthat dinner without making a small pitch of my own. ', '\"Look, I\\'ll make you a deal,\" I said. \"If I accept your offer, all I \\nask is that you give me three dinners a year at this very restaurant \\nfor as long as I\\'m at Deloitte. I\\'m in if you\\'re in.\" \\n\\nHe looked me in the eyes and then with the biggest smile said, \\n\\n\"Great. Welcome to Deloitte.\" \\n\\nBy the way, I then asked him for more money. He just shook \\nhis  head  and  laughed.  Well,  it  never  hurts  to  ask;  the  worst  he \\ncould have said was no. So, after three hours in a restaurant, this \\nman convinced me to make a life-changing career decision with-\\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c280 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nout  one  word  about  title,  salary,  or  even  one  detail  of how  he \\nexpected I might make a difference. \\n\\nHonestly,  I  still  had  my  doubts  at  the  beginning  that  I  had \\nmade the right move.  In consulting, Deloitte\\'s was  smaller pota \\ntoes those days; its prestige didn\\'t compare with McKinsey\\'s. ', \"But what a right move I had made—in fact, it was the best of \\nmy life. First, because I went to Deloitte Consulting, I was given \\nmore responsibilities and I learned more about consulting in the \\neight years  that followed than  most people learn  in  twenty.  Sec \\nond, I found I could make a difference given my access to the sen \\nior partners. Third, and most important, I realized that finding a \\ntalented, experienced mentor who is willing to invest the time and \\neffort  to  develop  you  as  a  person  and  a professional  is  far more \\nimportant than making career decisions based purely on salary or \\nprestige. \\n\\nBesides, back then the money wasn't important. You learn  in \\nyour twenties, as the  saying goes, and earn in your thirties. And \\nboy, did I ever learn. Each year, Pat and I had at least three dinners \\nat Grifone, that  same  Italian  restaurant.  For  my entire  tenure  at \\nDeloitte, I had the ear of the  CEO, and he kept asking about me \\namong his partners. He was looking out for me the entire time. \", \"Ultimately, of course, I got to work closely with Pat and other \\namazing men and women at Deloitte, and it taught me the impor \\ntance of attaching yourself to great people, great teachers. Not that \\nworking with Pat and his right-hand man Bob Kirk was easy. They \\ntaught  me  some  hard  lessons  about  staying  focused;  that  bold \\nideas weren't enough if they couldn't be executed; that the details \\nare as significant as the theories; that you had to put people  first, \\nall  people,  not  just  those  above  you.  Pat  probably  should  have \\nfired  me  a  few times.  Instead,  he  invested time  and  energy into \\nmaking me the kind of executive—and more important, the kind \\nof leader—he wanted me to be for the sake of the firm and for the \\nsake of his role as mentor. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cFind Mentors, Find Mentees, Repeat \\n\\n281 \\n\\nThere  were  two  crucial  components  that  made  my  mentorship \\nwith Pat—and makes any mentorship, for that matter—successful. \", 'return. I worked nonstop in an effort to use the knowledge he was \\nimparting to  make him, and his firm, more successful. And two, \\nwe created a situation that went beyond utility.  Pat liked me and \\nbecame emotionally invested in my advancement. He cared about \\nme.  That\\'s the key to  a successful mentorship. A successful men \\ntoring  relationship  needs  equal  parts  utility  and  emotion.  You \\ncan\\'t simply ask somebody to be personally invested in you. There \\nhas  to  be  some  reciprocity  involved—whether  its  hard  work  or \\nloyalty that you give in return—that gets someone to invest in you \\nin  the  first  place.  Then, when  the  process  kicks  in, you  have  to \\nmold your mentor into a coach; someone for whom your success \\nis in some small or big way his success. I owe so much to Pat. If it \\nwere  not for him,  I would not be  the man  I  am today. And that \\ngoes for so many others, starting with my Mom and Dad and Jack \\nPidgeon from the Kiski School, and my \"Uncle\" Bob Wilson, to so ', 'unmentioned but to whom I feel so close. \\n\\nThe best way to  approach  utility is to  give help first, and not \\nask for it. If there is someone whose knowledge you need, find a \\nway to be of use to that person. Consider their needs and how you \\ncan  assist them.  If you  can\\'t  help  them  specifically,  perhaps  you \\ncan contribute to their charity, company, or community. You have \\nto be prepared to give back to your mentors and have them know \\nthat  from  the  outset.  Before  Pat  would  consider  having  dinner \\nwith me three times a year, he had to know that I would be com \\nmitted  to  his  firm.  That\\'s  how  I  found  myself  so  early  on  in  a \\ntrusted position that later turned into a friendship. \\n\\nIf, however, there are no immediate opportunities to help, you \\nmust be  prudent  and conscious  of the  imposition you\\'re  placing \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c282 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\non that person. Almost every day, some ambitious young man or \\nwoman sends me an e-mail that states all too directly, \"I want a job.\" ', \"der at how deeply these young folks misunderstand the process. If \\nthey're  going  to  get  my help,  and  they haven't  even  offered  their \\nhelp  in  return,  then  at  minimum  they  should  attempt  to  endear \\nthemselves to me. Tell me why you're special. Tell me what we have \\nin common. Express gratitude, excitement, and passion. \\n\\nThe problem is often that these people have never had mentors \\nbefore and they have a limited view of how it works. Some people \\nthink there is just one  special  person  out there waiting to  be  all \\nthings  at all times to them.  But as my father taught me, mentors \\nare all around you. It's not necessarily your boss or even someone \\nin  your  business.  Mentoring  is  a  nonhierarchical  activity  that \\ntranscends careers and can cross all organizational levels. \\n\\nA CEO can learn from a manager, and vice versa. Some smart \\ncompanies, recognizing this fact, actually have programs in place \\nthat view new hires as mentors to the company. After a month on \\nthe  job,  they'll  ask  these  new  employees  to  jot  down  all  their \", 'problems and make innovative suggestions that others can\\'t. \\n\\nIn  fact,  the  people  I\\'ve  learned  so  much  from  are  my  own \\nyoung mentees, who help me periodically to update my skills and \\nview the world anew. \\n\\nAs much as you stretch yourself by reaching up, be sure you are \\nstretching just  as  far  to  reach  back  and  help  others.  I\\'ve  always \\ntaken the time to give young people a helping hand. Most of them \\nactually end up working for me at some point, either as interns or \\nemployees.  People like  Paul  Lussow, Chad Hodge, Hani Abisaid, \\nAndy  Bohn,  Brinda  Chugani,  Anna  Mongayt,  John  Lux,  Jason \\nAnnis. The list goes on and on. \\n\\nThere  are those who  don\\'t get it at first.  They sheepishly ask, \\n\"How can I ever repay you for all that you are doing?\" I tell them \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cFind Mentors, Find Mentees, Repeat \\n\\n283 \\n\\nthey\\'re  repaying me now. All  I  really expect  is  sincere  gratitude, ', '\\nTo see Brinda moving up at Deloitte, Hani becoming a partner \\nin one of my businesses  and \"graduating\" into  a new company I \\nhad a hand in forming, Chad becoming one of Hollywood\\'s most \\nsuccessful young writers, Andy becoming  a  player  in Hollywood \\nhimself, or Paul attending Wharton is a total thrill. It\\'s even more \\nso when they get to a point in their careers when they start becom \\ning mentors themselves. \\n\\nI  can\\'t  stress  enough  how  powerful  the  process  is  and  how \\nimportant it is that you give your respect and time to it. In return, \\nyou\\'ll  be  more  than  compensated with  spirit,  enthusiasm,  trust, \\nand empathy—all things that will  ultimately far exceed the value \\nof any advice you gave. \\n\\nIf you take mentoring seriously, and give it the time and energy \\nit  deserves,  you\\'ll  soon  find  yourself involved  in  a  learning  net \\nwork not unlike the one Intel uses.

In  her autobiog \\n\\nraphy,  she  wrote:  being  \"drawn  together  through  the  work  .  .  . \\n\\nis  .  .  .  one  of  the  most  satisfying  ways  of  making  and  keeping \\n\\nfriends.\"  Through  groups  such  as  the  International  Congress  of \\n\\nWorking  Women  and  the  Women\\'s  International  League  of  Peace \\n\\nand  Freedom  (WILPF),  Roosevelt  befriended  a  wide  circle  of \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c284 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nfriends—and  a  few  foes—in  advancing  some  of  the  great  social ', 'causes  of  our  time. \\n\\nThe  First  Lady was  not timid  about  using  her  personal  network  to \\n\\ntackle  testy  social  issues.  For  example,  she  fought  for  women\\'s \\n\\nrights  in  the  workplace—their  inclusion  in  labor  unions  and  their \\n\\nright  to  a  living  wage.  Today,  those  seem  like  uncontroversial \\n\\nissues,  but  during  the  late  1 920s  and  early  1 930s,  many  Ameri \\n\\ncans  blamed working  women  for  displacing  male  \"breadwinners\" \\n\\nin  the  midst  of  the  Great  Depression. \\n\\nRoosevelt  believed  the  beauty  and  obligation  of  living  in  a \\n\\ndemocracy was  to  make  a  stand  for  what you  believe  in;  and  she \\n\\nproved  you  could  do  so  while  gaining  the  trust  and  admiration  of \\n\\nyour  peers.  She  also  proved  that  sometimes  it  was  your  peers ', 'whom  you  need  to  stand  up  against. \\n\\nIn  1936,  thanks  largely to  the  First  Lady,  an  opera  singer  named \\n\\nMarian  Anderson  became  the  first  black  person  to  perform  at  the \\n\\nWhite  House.  But  Anderson\\'s  acceptance  at  1600  Pennsylvania \\n\\nAvenue  was  unusual.  Though  Anderson  was  the  country\\'s  third-\\n\\nhighest  concert  box-office  draw,  her  success  did  not  exempt  her \\n\\nfrom  the  racial  biases  that  pervaded  her  era.  When  traveling,  she \\n\\nwas  restricted  to  \"colored\" waiting  rooms,  hotels,  and  train  cars.  In \\n\\nthe  South,  newspapers  rarely  called  her  \"Miss  Anderson,\"  opting \\n\\nfor  \"Artist  Anderson\"  and  \"Singer  Anderson\"  instead. \\n\\nIn  1939,  Anderson\\'s  manager  and  Howard  University  tried  to \\n\\narrange  a  performance  at  Constitution  Hall  in  Washington,  D.C.

Roosevelt,  herself a  member \\n\\nof  the  D.A.R.,  promptly—and  publicly—resigned  her  membership \\n\\nto  protest.  In  a  letter to  the  D.A.R.,  she wrote:  \"/ am  in  complete dis \\n\\nagreement  with  the  attitude  taken  in  refusing  Constitution  Hall  to  a \\n\\ngreat  artist  .  .  .

Let\\'s take a look at a typical day. Monday: I was up at \\n4  A.M.  in  Los  Angeles  to  make  calls  to  my team  in  New York. \\nThen I worked the phone for a few more hours, trying to  organ \\nize a fundraiser for a candidate friend of mine. By 7 A.M., I was \\nat  the  airport  for  a  flight  to  Portland,  Oregon,  to  meet  a  new \\ncustomer  (with  two  cell  phones  buzzing,  fidgeting  with  my \\nBlackBerry, sending short e-mails, and my laptop  never far away ', 'on my way to Seattle and back on the phone, setting up meetings \\nfor  tonight,  tomorrow,  and  a  week  from  now.  I\\'m  in  constant \\ncontact with  my assistant, trying  to  get  invitations  out for  a big \\ndinner party I\\'m throwing in a month. In Seattle, I have a sched \\nuled dinner with the folks organizing Bill Gates\\'s CEO conference \\nthis  year,  after  which  I\\'ll  have  drinks  with  some  close  friends. \\nAnd tomorrow, there will be another 4 A.M. wake-up call to do it \\nall again. \\n\\nWelcome  to  what  my  friends  jokingly  refer  to  as  \"Ferrazzi \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cBalance Is B.S. \\n\\n287 \\n\\nTime,\" a zone of operations in which the switchboards are always \\nopen and the rush of humanity is ongoing. \\n\\nWitnessing such  a schedule begs  a number of very important \\nquestions: Is this a life? Operating in such a way, can one have bal \\nance between work and having a life? And do you—God forbid— \\nhave to operate in Ferrazzi Time to be successful? ', \"The answers are: Yes, it is a life, albeit my own; yes, you can find \\nbalance, albeit your own; and no, thank heavens, you don't have to \\ndo it my way. \\n\\nFor me, the best thing about a relationship-driven career is that \\nit isn't a career at all. It's a way of living. Several years ago, I started \\nto realize that connecting was  actually a way of seeing the world. \\nWhen I thought and behaved in that way, dividing my life between \\nprofessional and personal spheres no longer made sense. I realized \\nthat what  made you  successful  in  both worlds were  other  people \\nand the way you related to them. Whether those people were fam \\nily people, work  people,  or friend  people,  real  connecting  insists \\nthat you bring the same values to every relationship. As a result, I \\nno longer needed to make a distinction between my career happi \\nness and my life happiness—they were both pieces of me. My life. \\nWhen it became clear to me that the key to my life was the rela \\ntionships  in  it,  I  found there was  no  longer  a  need  to  compart \", 'birthday at a business  conference  and be  surrounded with warm \\nand wonderful friends, as I recently did, or I could be at home in \\nLos Angeles or New York with equally close friends to celebrate. \\n\\nThe kind of false idea of balance as some sort of an equation, that \\nyou could take this many hours from one side of your life and give \\nit to this other side, flew out the window. And with it went all the \\nstress of trying to achieve that perfect state of equilibrium we read \\nand hear so much about. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c288 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nBalance can\\'t be bought or sold. It doesn\\'t need to be \"imple \\nmented.\" Balance is a mind-set, as  individual and unique as our \\ngenetic  code.  Where  you  find  joy,  you  find  balance.  My wacky \\nschedule works for me and perhaps only for me. The blurring of \\nprofessional  and personal lives  isn\\'t for  everyone.  The  important \\nthing is to see connecting with others not just as another manipu \\nlative tool used toward achieving a goal but rather as a way of life. \\nWhen you\\'re out of balance, you\\'ll know because you\\'ll be rushed, ', 'enthusiastic, and full of gratitude. \\n\\nDon\\'t  worry  about  trying  to  develop  your  own  version  of \\nFerrazzi Time. The way you reach out to others is the way you eat \\nan 800-pound elephant: one small bite at a time. \\n\\nIn  the  end, we  all  live  one  life. And  that  life  is  all  about  the \\n\\npeople we live it with. \\n\\nMore  People, More Balance \\n\\nIf you buy into the myth of balance (the one that sees life as an \\nequation), as I once did, the answers to such questions as \"If I\\'m so \\n\\'accomplished,\\' why aren\\'t I having more fun?\" or \"If I\\'m so \\'organ \\nized,\\' why do I feel so out of control?\" is to \"simplify,\" \"compartmen \\ntalize,\" or \"reduce\" your life into its most essential components. \\n\\nSo we try to  save time by eating our lunches  at our desk. We \\nhave less  serendipitous  conversations with  colleagues,  strangers, \\nand other \"nonessentials\" at the water cooler. We consolidate our \\nschedules to include only the most important actions. ', 'People tell  us, \"If you just  get more  organized, if you strike  a \\nbalance between work and home, and limit yourself to the impor \\ntant people in your life, you\\'ll feel better.\" That\\'s just totally mis \\nguided. What they should be saying is \"I gotta get a life filled with \\npeople I love.\" The problem, as I see it, isn\\'t what you\\'re working \\non, it\\'s whom you\\'re working with. \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cBalance Is B.S. \\n\\n289 \\n\\nYou can\\'t feel in love with your life if you hate your work; and, \\nmore  times  than  not,  people  don\\'t love  their work because they \\nwork with people they don\\'t like. Connecting with others doubles \\nand triples your opportunities to  meet with  people that  can lead \\nto a new and exciting job. \\n\\nI  think  the  problem  in  today\\'s  world  isn\\'t  that  we  have  too \\nmany people in our lives, it\\'s that we don\\'t have enough. Dr. Will \\nMiller and Glenn Sparks, in their book Refrigerator Rights: Creat \\ning Connections and Restoring Relationships, argue that with our ', 'overwhelming media distractions available to us, we lead lives of \\nrelative isolation. \\n\\nHow many people can walk into our homes and just open up the \\nfridge  and  help  themselves?  Not  many.  People  need  \"refrigerator \\nrights  relationships,\" the kind that  are  comfortable,  informal,  and \\nintimate enough to let us walk into one another\\'s kitchens and rum \\nmage  through  the  refrigerator without  asking.  It  is  close  relation \\nships like these that keep us well-adjusted, happy, and successful. \\n\\nAmerica\\'s focus  on individualism works against reaching out \\nto  others.  Comparative studies  on levels of job stress  and worker \\ndissatisfaction  show  that  people  of individualistic  cultures  typi \\ncally  report  much  higher  stress  levels  than  do  the  people  who \\nwork in more  community-oriented cultures.  In spite of our high \\nstandard  of living,  wealth  and  privilege  haven\\'t  produced  emo \\ntional  well-being.  Instead,  as  these  studies  show,  it\\'s  a  sense  of ', '\\nWhen our lonely lives catch up with us, we turn to self-help lit \\nerature for answers, but it isn\\'t SELF-help we need, I\\'d argue, it\\'s \\nhelp  from  others.  If you  buy this,  and  I  hope  that you  do,  then \\nwhat I teach in this book is the perfect antidote to all this talk of \\nimbalance.

I  remember as  a young \\nman, for instance, dreaming of owning my own Brooks  Brothers \\nbutton-down  shirt. All throughout my years  growing up, I wore \\nhand-me-downs  from my mom's  cleaning  customers' kids  or I'd \\nfind  my clothes  in secondhand thrift shops. I thought that when \\nthe day came that I  could walk into  a shop like Brooks  Brothers \\nand buy my own firsthand shirt  (for  retail!), well, that would be \\nthe day I arrived. \\n\\nThat day came. I was in my mid-twenties and I proudly bought \\nthe  finest,  most  expensive  button-down  shirt  Brooks  Brothers \\nsold. The next day I wore that shirt into work as if it were a rare, \\nemerald-studded gown from the Victorian era. Then I washed it. I \\nremember  pulling  my  shirt  from  the  washer  and—gasp!—two \\nbuttons had fallen off. I kid you not. This, I asked myself, is what \", '\\nAs  noted  author  and  speaker  Rabbi  Harold  Kushner  once \\nwisely wrote, \"Our souls are not hungry for fame, comfort, wealth, \\nor power. Those rewards create almost as many problems as they \\nsolve. Our souls are hungry for meaning, for the sense that we have \\nfigured  out how to live so that our lives matter so the world will at \\nleast be a little bit different for our having passed through it.\" \\n\\nBut  it  would  take  many  more  missing  buttons  before  I  truly \\nstarted to ask myself what meaning, exactly, my soul was hungry for. \\nThat time finally came with what I call my own personal mini-\\nrevolution.  Revolutions  sometimes  begin  in  the  least  likely  of \\nplaces  with  the  least likely of heroes. Who  could  imagine  that  a \\nsmall Indian man with a very strong accent could challenge what \\nI wanted out of life and how I was going to attain it? Or that doing \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cWelcome to the Connected Age \\n\\n295 \\n\\nnothing and remaining silent for ten days, rather than trying to do \\neverything all at once, could change the course of my life? ', 'The first shot in my revolution happened, in all places, while I \\nwas in Switzerland for The World Economic Forum, attending an \\noversubscribed talk entitled,  simply, \"Happiness.\" The room was \\njam-packed with  the world\\'s  rich  and  powerful—a  clear  indica \\ntion  that  there were  others  in  my midst who  had  experienced  a \\nfew missing buttons of their own. \\n\\nWe  were  gathered  together  to  hear  a  short,  stout,  and  thor \\noughly happy-looking man named S. N. Goenka deliver a speech \\non how he, as a businessman-turned-guru, found health and hap \\npiness  through  an  ancient  tradition  of  meditation  known  as \\nVipassana. \\n\\nGoenka slowly shuffled to the podium and launched into a talk \\nthat  enraptured  the  entire  audience  for  the  next  hour.  With  his \\nwords, we were all transported into our own heads, forced to con \\nfront  the  feelings  of inadequacy,  stress,  and  imbalance  that  still \\naccompanied our seemingly successful lives. ', 'Not a word was  spoken  about business, per se. There was no \\ntalk of balance  sheets  or  influential  contacts.  Happiness, he told \\nus, had nothing to do with how much money we made or how we \\nmade it. \\n\\nThere is only one place to find real peace, real harmony. That \\nplace is within, Goenka told us. And while we may be masters of \\nbusiness, it was clear that we were not masters of our own minds \\nand souls. \\n\\nThere was a way, he said, to ask the right questions and become \\nmasters of our mind. Vipassana, we were told, is an insight medi \\ntation  technique  that  means  \"to  see  things  as  they  really  are.\" \\nIt  was  a  technology  for  inner  peace  that  could  drive  fear  from \\nthe heart and help  us have the  courage to  be who we really are. \\nGoenka described a grueling ten-day course, during which practi \\ntioners sit for hours-long stretches in absolute silence, without eye \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c296 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone ', \"contact,  writing,  or  communication  of  any  kind  except  with \\nteachers at the end of each day. \\n\\nIt was up to us. No, it was within us to live a happy and mean \\ningful  life. We just had to  ask the  right  questions  and  spend the \\ntime looking and listening. \\n\\nWhile  I'm  not  sure  how  many  of my  fellow  executives  were \\nintent  on  learning  Vipassana,  it  was  clear  that  Goenka  had \\ntouched u s . .. deeply. He made us feel, at least for that moment, \\nthat we had the  power to  make  our work and lives  mean  some \\nthing, that it could be important, that it could make a difference, \\nand that we could learn to be happy if only we took the time to lis \\nten to what our souls were telling us. \\n\\nI left refreshed and inspired, but I was sure that I would never \\nlearn  Vipassana.  Ten  days  with  no  conference  calls,  no  power \\nlunches, no talking . . . ten DAYS! Impossible. I could never find \", '\\nThen, suddenly, I had all the time in the world. After my depar \\nture from Starwood, one too many buttons had gone missing and \\nI was in need of clarity—and happiness. \\n\\nUntil  that  moment,  I  thought  I  didn\\'t  have  enough  time,  or \\ncourage, for ten  days  of introspection.  But  eventually I  took the \\nVipassana  course  and  learned,  for what  seemed  the first time  in \\nmy  life,  to  slow  down  and  truly  listen.  In  the  process  I  shed \\nmany—though  not  all—of the  thoughts  of what  I  \"should\"  and \\n\"ought\" to be doing. \\n\\nIf  you  commit  yourself  to  finding  your  passion,  that  blue \\nflame,  it\\'s  interesting  how  that  commitment  is  rewarded  with \\nanswers.  The  answers  that  came  to  me  after  all  that  meditation \\nhelped  me  to  reevaluate  my  pursuit  of prestige  and  money  and ', \"\\nVipassana certainly isn't the only way to get clarity, but so few \\nof us give ourselves the time and space we need to come to a bet \\nter understanding  of who we  are  and what we  really want.  How \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0cWelcome to the Connected Age \\n\\n297 \\n\\nhad I—along with so many other perfectly capable and intelligent \\npeople I knew—allowed my life to get so far out of whack? By fail \\ning  to  ask  ourselves  the  kinds  of  questions  that  are  the  most \\nimportant: What is your passion? What truly gives you pleasure? \\nHow can you make a difference? \\n\\nWhen I left the meditation course and got back to the routine \\nof my life, I was like a kid in a candy store. There were so many \\npeople I wanted to meet!  So many people I wanted to help!  The \\npursuit of achievement  could be,  I  realized,  so much fun  and  so \\ninspiring when you knew what was worthy of achieving. \\n\\nWe've  been  taught to  see life  as  a  quest,  a journey that  ends \", 'golden years  golden. There is, however, no  end, no final arrival; \\nthe quest never quite ends. There is no one job title or one Brooks \\nBrothers shirt or one dollar amount that can ever act as the ulti \\nmate finishing line. Which is why the achievement of some goals \\ncan feel as disappointing as failure. \\n\\nLiving a connected life leads one to take a different view. Life is \\nless  a quest than  a  quilt. We  find  meaning, love,  and  prosperity \\nthrough  the  process  of  stitching  together  our  bold  attempts  to \\nhelp others find their own way in their lives. The relationships we \\nweave become an exquisite and endless pattern. \\n\\nThere is a line in a lovely movie called How to Make an Ameri \\ncan Quilt that sums up this philosophy nicely: \"Young lovers seek \\nperfection.  Old lovers  sew shreds  together and  see beauty in the \\nmultiplicity of patches.\" \\n\\nWhat will  be  the  legacy of your  own  quilt?  How will  you  be \\nremembered?  These  questions  are  potent  measuring  sticks  for \\nanyone who  cares  about making  a  difference,  not just making  a ', 'world, as long as you remember that doing so also means wanting \\nto be the best for the world. \\n\\nRemember that  love,  reciprocity,  and knowledge  are  not  like \\n\\nwww.urdukutabkhanapk.blogspot.com\\x0c298 \\n\\nNever Eat Alone \\n\\nbank  accounts  that  grow  smaller  as  you  use  them.  Creativity \\nbegets  more  creativity,  money  begets  more  money,  knowl \\nedge  begets  more  knowledge,  more  friends  beget  more  friends, \\nsuccess begets  even more success. Most important, giving begets \\ngiving. At no time in history has this law of abundance been more \\napparent than in this connected age where the world increasingly \\nfunctions in accord with networking principles. \\n\\nWherever you are in life right now, and whatever you know, is \\na result of the ideas, experiences, and people you have interacted \\nwith  in your life, whether in  person,  through  books  and  music, \\ne-mail, or culture. There is no score to keep when abundance leads \\nto  even more abundance.  So make a decision that from this  day ', 'knowledge,  experiences,  and  people  to  help  you  achieve  your \\ngoals. \\n\\nBut  first  be  honest  with  yourself.  How  much  time  are  you \\nready to  spend  on reaching  out  and  giving before you  get?  How \\nmany mentors  do  you  have?  How many  people  have  you  men-\\ntored? What do you love to do? How do you want to live? Whom \\ndo you want to be part of your quilt? \\n\\nFrom my own experience, I can tell you the answers will come \\nas  a surprise. What\\'s  important probably won\\'t come down to  a \\njob,  a company,  or a  cool new piece  of technology.  It will  come \\ndown to people. It\\'s up to each of us, working together with peo \\nple we love, to make the world a world we want to live in. As the \\nanthropologist  Margaret  Mead  once  said,  \"Never  doubt  that  a \\nsmall  group  of  thoughtful,  committed  citizens  can  change  the \\nworld. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.\" It is my hope that ', \"We are all in this together.

It’s also a toolbox full of techniques that you can apply in \\n\\nyour own way to your own process.\\n\\nWhether you’re a founder, CTO, product manager, designer, or de-\\n\\nveloper, you’re probably here because of some common challenges \\n\\nthat all software companies have to face.', 'Growing pains\\nAs software teams start to grow, some common struggles appear:\\n\\n•  Team members feel like projects go on \\n\\nand on, with no end in sight.\\n\\n•  Product managers can’t find time to think \\n\\nstrategically about the product.\\n\\n•  Founders ask themselves: “Why can’t we get features \\n\\nout the door like we used to in the early days?”\\n\\nWe saw these challenges first-hand at Basecamp as we grew from \\n\\nfour people to over fifty.\\n\\nBasecamp started off in 2003 as a tool we built for ourselves. At the \\n\\ntime we were a consultancy designing websites for clients. Infor-\\n\\nmation would get lost in the game of telephone between the client, \\n\\nthe designer, and the person managing the project. We wanted \\n\\nBasecamp to be a centralized place where all parties could see \\n\\nthe work, discuss it, and know what to do next. It turned out lots \\n\\nof companies had this “information slipping through the cracks” \\n\\nproblem. Today millions of people across all kinds of industries rely \\n\\nC H A P T E R   1   -   IN T R O D U C T I O N\\n\\n1 1\\n\\n\\x0con Basecamp as their shared source of truth.\\n\\nThree of us built the first version. Jason Fried, Basecamp’s founder, ', 'led the design. His co-founder, David Heinemeier Hansson, pro-\\n\\ngrammed it (and created the well-known web framework Ruby on \\n\\nRails as a by-product). At the time I was a web designer with a focus \\n\\non usability and user interfaces. I executed Jason’s design direc-\\n\\ntion for key features of the app and collaborated with him to fill in \\n\\ndetails of the concept.\\n\\nFrom the first prototypes in July 2003 to launch in February 2004, \\n\\nDavid only worked ten hours a week. We knew we wouldn’t get any-\\n\\nwhere with those ten hours of programming unless we used them \\n\\nvery deliberately. Our intense focus on “hammering” the scope to \\n\\nfit within a given time budget was born under these constraints.\\n\\nAs the business grew, I started widening my skills. Working with \\n\\nDavid and Ruby on Rails made the world of programming accessi-\\n\\nble to me. I learned the techniques programmers use to tame com-\\n\\nplexity: things like factoring, levels of abstraction, and separation \\n\\nof concerns. With one foot in the design world and one foot in the \\n\\nprogramming world, I wondered if we could apply these software \\n\\ndevelopment principles to the way we designed and managed  \\n\\nthe product.\\n\\nThe first test of this idea came in 2009. By then we had hired a few ', 'more programmers and offered four separate software-as-a-service \\n\\nproducts. We wanted to bundle the products together into a seam-\\n\\nless suite with single-sign-on and unified billing. It was a massive \\n\\ntechnical undertaking with treacherous user-facing flows. Besides \\n\\ngetting the underlying architecture right, we had to interrupt cus-\\n\\ntomers on their way in to the product and make them change their \\n\\n1 2\\n\\n\\x0cusername and password for reasons that weren’t easy to explain. \\n\\nI wore the designer and product manager hats on the project and \\n\\nprototyped the breadboarding and scope mapping techniques \\n\\ndescribed in this book to manage the complexity.\\n\\nWe had such good results that we decided to apply the same tech-\\n\\nniques again in 2012, when we redesigned Basecamp from scratch \\n\\nfor version 2.0. Again there was a lot of surface area to manage and \\n\\nagain the process was surprisingly smooth.\\n\\nBy 2015, we had a core team that had lived through these expe-\\n\\nriences and hit an impressive stride. But we found it hard to ar-\\n\\nticulate what we were doing to new hires. Our product team had \\n\\nquadrupled and everyone worked remotely. That made it hard to \\n\\npass on our intuitions. We needed language to describe what we ', 'were doing and more structure to keep doing it at our new scale.\\n\\nTo manage this new capacity, we switched from ad-hoc project \\n\\nlengths to repeating cycles. (It took some experimentation to find \\n\\nthe right cycle length: six weeks. More on that later.) We formalized \\n\\nour pitching and betting processes. My role shifted again, from \\n\\ndesign and product management to product strategy. I needed new \\n\\nlanguage, like the word “shaping”, to describe the up-front design \\n\\nwork we did to set boundaries and reduce risks on projects before \\n\\nwe committed them to teams.\\n\\nJust as we were getting better at articulating the way we work to \\n\\nourselves, more and more of our friends and peers started coming \\n\\nto us to ask how we do it. Finally Jason pulled me aside one day \\n\\nand said, I think you should write a book about this.\\n\\nThis is the result. You can think of this as two books in one. First, \\n\\nit’s a book of basic truths. I want it to give you better language to \\n\\nC H A P T E R   1   -   IN T R O D U C T I O N\\n\\n1 3\\n\\n\\x0cdescribe and deal with the risks, uncertainties, and challenges that ', 'come up whenever you do product development. Second, the book \\n\\noutlines the specific processes we’re using to make meaningful \\n\\nprogress on our products at our current scale.\\n\\nHere’s a short overview of the main ideas in the book.\\n\\nSix-week cycles\\nFirst, we work in six-week cycles. Six weeks is long enough to \\n\\nbuild something meaningful start-to-finish and short enough that \\n\\neveryone can feel the deadline looming from the start, so they use \\n\\nthe time wisely. The majority of our new features are built and \\n\\nreleased in one six-week cycle.\\n\\nOur decisions are based on moving the product forward in the \\n\\nnext six weeks, not micromanaging time. We don’t count hours or \\n\\nquestion how individual days are spent. We don’t have daily meet-\\n\\nings. We don’t rethink our roadmap every two weeks. Our focus is \\n\\nat a higher level. We say to ourselves: “If this project ships after six \\n\\nweeks, we’ll be really happy. We’ll feel our time was well spent.” \\n\\nThen we commit the six weeks and leave the team alone to get  \\n\\nit done.\\n\\nShaping the work\\nSecond, we shape the work before giving it to a team. A small \\n\\nsenior group works in parallel to the cycle teams. They define the ', 'key elements of a solution before we consider a project ready to bet \\n\\non. Projects are defined at the right level of abstraction: concrete \\n\\nenough that the teams know what to do, yet abstract enough that \\n\\nthey have room to work out the interesting details themselves.\\n\\nWhen shaping, we focus less on estimates and more on our \\n\\n1 4\\n\\n\\x0cappetite. Instead of asking how much time it will take to do some \\n\\nwork, we ask: How much time do we want to spend? How much is \\n\\nthis idea worth? This is the task of shaping: narrowing down the \\n\\nproblem and designing the outline of a solution that fits within the \\n\\nconstraints of our appetite.\\n\\nMaking teams responsible\\nThird, we give full responsibility to a small integrated team of \\n\\ndesigners and programmers. They define their own tasks, make \\n\\nadjustments to the scope, and work together to build vertical slices \\n\\nof the product one at a time. This is completely different from other \\n\\nmethodologies, where managers chop up the work and program-\\n\\nmers act like ticket-takers.\\n\\nTogether, these concepts form a virtuous circle. When teams are \\n\\nmore autonomous, senior people can spend less time managing \\n\\nthem. With less time spent on management, senior people can \\n\\nshape up better projects. When projects are better shaped, teams ', 'have clearer boundaries and so can work more autonomously.\\n\\nTargeting risk\\nAt every step of the process we target a specific risk: the risk of not \\n\\nshipping on time. This book isn’t about the risk of building the \\n\\nwrong thing. Other books can help you with that (we recommend \\n\\nCompeting Against Luck). Improving your discovery process should \\n\\ncome after regaining your ability to ship. You can have the best \\n\\nstrategy in the world, but if you can’t act on it, what good does  \\n\\nit do?\\n\\nThis book is about the risk of getting stuck, the risk of getting \\n\\nbogged down with last quarter’s work, wasting time on unexpected \\n\\nC H A P T E R   1   -   IN T R O D U C T I O N\\n\\n1 5\\n\\n\\x0cproblems, and not being free to do what you want to do tomorrow.\\n\\nWe reduce risk in the shaping process by solving open questions \\n\\nbefore we commit the project to a time box. We don’t give a project \\n\\nto a team that still has rabbit holes or tangled interdependencies.\\n\\nWe reduce risk in the planning process by capping our bets to six \\n\\nweeks. If a project runs over, by default it doesn’t get an extension. ', 'This “circuit breaker” ensures that we don’t invest multiples of the \\n\\noriginal appetite on a concept that needs rethinking first.\\n\\nAnd lastly we reduce risk in the building process by integrating \\n\\ndesign and programming early. Instead of building lots of discon-\\n\\nnected parts and hoping they’ll fit together in the 11th hour, we \\n\\nbuild one meaningful piece of the work end-to-end early on and \\n\\nthen repeat. The team sequences the work from the most unknown \\n\\nto the least worrisome pieces and learns what works and what \\n\\ndoesn’t by integrating as soon as possible.\\n\\nHow this book is organized\\nPart One is all about Shaping — the pre-work we do on projects \\n\\nbefore we consider them ready to schedule. Each chapter explains \\n\\na specific step of the process, from setting the appetite on a raw \\n\\nidea, to sketching out a solution, to writing a pitch that presents \\n\\nthe potential project. Along the way you’ll learn specific techniques \\n\\n— like breadboarding and fat-marker sketching — to keep the design \\n\\nat the right level of abstraction.\\n\\nPart Two is about Betting — how we choose among the pitched \\n\\nprojects and decide what to do six weeks at a time.\\n\\nPart Three is about Building — the expectations we place on the ', 'teams and the special practices they use to discover what to do. \\n\\n1 6\\n\\n\\x0cWe’ll look at how the teams figure out what to do, how they in-\\n\\ntegrate design and programming, how they track what’s known \\n\\nversus unknown, and finally how they make the hard calls to finish \\n\\nthe project on time.\\n\\nLastly the Appendix gives you some help for when it’s time to make \\n\\nchanges at your company. There’s some advice on how to try your \\n\\nfirst six-week experiment, tips on adjusting the methods to your \\n\\ncompany’s size, and specific guidance for how to implement Shape \\n\\nUp using Basecamp.\\n\\nC H A P T E R   1   -   IN T R O D U C T I O N\\n\\n1 7\\n\\n\\x0c\\x0cP A R T   O N E\\n\\nShaping\\n\\n\\x0cPrinciples of Shaping\\n\\nWhen we shape the work, we need to do it at the right level of \\n\\nabstraction: not too vague and not too concrete. Product managers \\n\\noften err on one of these two extremes.\\n\\nWireframes are too concrete\\nWhen design leaders go straight to wireframes or high-fidelity \\n\\nmockups, they define too much detail too early. This leaves design-\\n\\ners no room for creativity. One friend put it this way:', 'I’ll give a wireframe to my designer, and then I’m saying to her: \\n\\n“I know you’re looking at this, but that’s not what I want you to \\n\\ndesign. I want you to re-think it!” It’s hard to do that when you’re \\n\\ngiving them this concrete thing.\\n\\nOver-specifying the design also leads to estimation errors. Counter-\\n\\nintuitive as it may seem, the more specific the work is, the harder it \\n\\ncan be to estimate. That’s because making the interface just so can \\n\\n2 0\\n\\n\\x0crequire solving hidden complexities and implementation details \\n\\nthat weren’t visible in the mockup. When the scope isn’t variable, \\n\\nthe team can’t reconsider a design decision that is turning out to \\n\\ncost more than it’s worth.\\n\\nWords are too abstract\\nOn the other end of the spectrum, projects that are too vague don’t \\n\\nwork either. When a project is defined in a few words, nobody \\n\\nknows what it means. “Build a calendar view” or “add group \\n\\nnotifications” sound sensible, but what exactly do they entail? \\n\\nTeam members don’t have enough information to make trade-offs. \\n\\nThey don’t know what to include or leave out. A programmer who \\n\\nworked in that situation said:', 'You’re solving a problem with no context. You have to be a mind \\n\\nreader. It’s like: “we’ll know it when we see it.”\\n\\nConcerning estimation, under-specified projects naturally grow out \\n\\nof control because there’s no boundary to define what’s out of scope.\\n\\nCase study: The Dot Grid Calendar\\nLet’s look at an example of how to shape a project at the right level \\n\\nof detail.\\n\\nWe launched version three of Basecamp without a calendar feature. \\n\\nIt had a “schedule” feature that just listed events one after the other \\n\\nwithout any kind of monthly, weekly or daily grid.\\n\\nSoon after launch, customers started asking us to “add a calendar” \\n\\nto Basecamp. We had built calendars before and we knew how \\n\\ncomplex they are. It can easily take six months or more to build a \\n\\nproper calendar.\\n\\nC H A P T E R   2   -   PR I N C I P L E S  O F   SH A P I N G\\n\\n2 1\\n\\n\\x0cThese are the kinds of things that make a calendar complicated:\\n\\n•  Dragging and dropping events between cells to move them\\n\\n•  Wrapping multi-day events around the edge of the screen\\n\\n•  Different views for monthly, weekly, or daily time scales', '•  Dragging the edge of an event to change its duration\\n\\n•  Color coding events for different categories\\n\\n•  Handling different expectations for \\n\\ndesktop vs.\\xa0mobile interactions\\n\\nPast versions of Basecamp had calendars, and only about 10% of \\n\\ncustomers used them. That’s why we didn’t have the appetite for \\n\\nspending six months on a calendar. On the other hand, if we could \\n\\ndo something to satisfy those customers who were writing us in one \\n\\nsix week cycle, we were open to doing that.\\n\\nWith only six weeks to work with, we could only build about a tenth \\n\\nof what people think of when they say “calendar.” The question \\n\\nbecame: which tenth?\\n\\nWe did some research (discussed in the next chapter) and narrowed \\n\\ndown a use case that we wanted to solve. We eventually arrived at \\n\\na promising concept inspired by calendars on phones. We could \\n\\nbuild a two-month, read-only grid view. Any day with an event \\n\\nwould have a dot for each event. A list of events would appear \\n\\nbelow the calendar, and clicking a day with a dot would scroll the \\n\\nevents for that day into view. We called it the Dot Grid.\\n\\nThe Dot Grid wasn’t a full-featured calendar. We weren’t going to ', 'allow dragging events between days. We weren’t going to span \\n\\n2 2\\n\\n\\x0cmulti-day events across the grid; we’d just repeat the dots. There’d \\n\\nbe no color coding or categories for events. We were comfortable \\n\\nwith all these trade-offs because of our understanding of the  \\n\\nuse case.\\n\\nThis is the level of fidelity we used to define the solution:\\n\\nRough sketch of the Dot Grid concept\\n\\nNote how rough the sketch is and how many details are left out. \\n\\nThe designer had a lot of room to interpret how this should look \\n\\nand feel.\\n\\nC H A P T E R   2   -   PR I N C I P L E S  O F   SH A P I N G\\n\\n2 3\\n\\n\\x0cAt the same time, note how specific the idea is. It’s very clear how it \\n\\nworks, what needs to be built, what’s in and what’s out.\\n\\nAt the end of the project, the finished work that the designers and \\n\\nprogrammers created looked like this:\\n\\nScreenshot of the Dot Grid when it launched\\n\\nThis small example highlights a few properties of shaped work.\\n\\nProperty 1: It’s rough\\nWork in the shaping stage is rough. Everyone can tell by looking \\n\\nat it that it’s unfinished. They can see the open spaces where ', 'their contributions will go. Work that’s too fine, too early commits \\n\\n2 4\\n\\n\\x0ceveryone to the wrong details. Designers and programmers need \\n\\nroom to apply their own judgement and expertise when they roll up \\n\\ntheir sleeves and discover all the real trade-offs that emerge.\\n\\nProperty 2: It’s solved\\nDespite being rough and unfinished, shaped work has been \\n\\nthought through. All the main elements of the solution are there at \\n\\nthe macro level and they connect together. The work isn’t specified \\n\\ndown to individual tasks, but the overall solution is spelled out. \\n\\nWhile surprises might still happen and icebergs could still emerge, \\n\\nthere is clear direction showing what to do. Any open questions or \\n\\nrabbit holes we could see up front have been removed to reduce the \\n\\nproject’s risk.\\n\\nProperty 3: It’s bounded\\nLastly, shaped work indicates what not to do. It tells the team where \\n\\nto stop. There’s a specific appetite—the amount of time the team \\n\\nis allowed to spend on the project. Completing the project within \\n\\nthat fixed amount of time requires limiting the scope and leaving \\n\\nspecific things out.\\n\\nTaken together, the roughness leaves room for the team to resolve \\n\\nall the details, while the solution and boundaries act like guard ', 'rails. They reduce risk and channel the team’s efforts, making sure \\n\\nthey don’t build too much, wander around, or get stuck.\\n\\nWho shapes\\nShaping is creative and integrative. It requires combining interface \\n\\nideas with technical possibilities with business priorities. To do \\n\\nthat you’ll need to either embody these skills as a generalist or \\n\\ncollaborate with one or two other people.\\n\\nC H A P T E R   2   -   PR I N C I P L E S  O F   SH A P I N G\\n\\n2 5\\n\\n\\x0cShaping is primarily design work. The shaped concept is an interac-\\n\\ntion design viewed from the user’s perspective. It defines what the \\n\\nfeature does, how it works, and where it fits into existing flows.\\n\\nYou don’t need to be a programmer to shape, but you need to be \\n\\ntechnically literate. You should be able to judge what’s possible, \\n\\nwhat’s easy and what’s hard. Knowledge about how the system \\n\\nworks will help you see opportunities or obstacles for implement-\\n\\ning your idea.\\n\\nIt’s also strategic work. Setting the appetite and coming up with a \\n\\nsolution requires you to be critical about the problem. What are we \\n\\ntrying to solve? Why does it matter? What counts as success? Which ', 'customers are affected? What is the cost of doing this instead of \\n\\nsomething else?\\n\\nShaping is a closed-door, creative process. You might be alone \\n\\nsketching on paper or in front of a whiteboard with a close col-\\n\\nlaborator. There’ll be rough diagrams in front of you that nobody \\n\\noutside the room would be able to interpret. When working with \\n\\na collaborator, you move fast, speak frankly and jump from one \\n\\npromising position to another. It’s that kind of private, rough,  \\n\\nearly work.\\n\\nTwo tracks\\nYou can’t really schedule shaping work because, by its very nature, \\n\\nunshaped work is risky and unknown. For that reason we have \\n\\ntwo separate tracks: one for shaping, one for building. During any \\n\\nsix week cycle, the teams are building work that’s been previously \\n\\nshaped and the shapers are working on what the teams might po-\\n\\ntentially build in a future cycle. Work on the shaping track is kept \\n\\nprivate and not shared with the wider team until the commitment \\n\\n2 6\\n\\n\\x0chas been made to bet on it. That gives the shapers the option to put \\n\\nwork-in-progress on the shelf or drop it when it’s not working out.\\n\\nSteps to shaping', '\\nfour chapters.\\n\\n1. Set boundaries. First we figure out how much time \\n\\nthe raw idea is worth and how to define the problem. \\n\\nThis gives us the basic boundaries to shape into.\\n\\n2. Rough out the elements. Then comes the creative work \\n\\nof sketching a solution. We do this at a higher level of \\n\\nabstraction than wireframes in order to move fast and \\n\\nexplore a wide enough range of possibilities. The output \\n\\nof this step is an idea that solves the problem within the \\n\\nappetite but without all the fine details worked out.\\n\\n3. Address risks and rabbit holes. Once we think we have a \\n\\nsolution, we take a hard look at it to find holes or unanswered \\n\\nquestions that could trip up the team. We amend the solu-\\n\\ntion, cut things out of it, or specify details at certain tricky \\n\\nspots to prevent the team from getting stuck or wasting time.\\n\\n4. Write the pitch. Once we think we’ve shaped it enough to \\n\\npotentially bet on, we package it with a formal write-up called \\n\\na pitch. The pitch summarizes the problem, constraints, solu-\\n\\ntion, rabbit holes, and limitations. The pitch goes to the betting \\n\\ntable for consideration. If the project gets chosen, the pitch ', 'can be re-used at kick-off to explain the project to the team.\\n\\nC H A P T E R   2   -   PR I N C I P L E S  O F   SH A P I N G\\n\\n2 7\\n\\n\\x0cSet Boundaries\\n\\nThe first step of shaping is setting boundaries on what we’re trying \\n\\nto do. The conversations we have are going to be entirely different if \\n\\npeople think we’re talking about a small improvement or a  \\n\\nmajor redesign.\\n\\nThe conversation about building a feature always starts with a raw \\n\\nidea, like “customers are asking for group notifications.” Before \\n\\nwe all go down the rabbit hole discussing ways we can solve it, we \\n\\nshould first set some broad terms on the discussion to make  \\n\\nit productive.\\n\\nSetting the appetite\\nSometimes an idea gets us excited right away. In that case we need \\n\\nto temper the excitement by checking whether this is really some-\\n\\nthing we’re going to be able to invest time in or not. If we don’t stop \\n\\nto think about how valuable the idea is, we can all jump too quickly \\n\\nto either committing resources or having long discussions about \\n\\npotential solutions that go nowhere.\\n\\n2 8\\n\\n\\x0cOther ideas are less exciting and feel more like a challenge we ', 'didn’t ask for. The customer wants a calendar; we don’t particularly \\n\\nwant to build one, but we do feel we need to do something about  \\n\\nthe request.\\n\\nWhether we’re chomping at the bit or reluctant to dive in, it helps \\n\\nto explicitly define how much of our time and attention the subject \\n\\ndeserves. Is this something worth a quick fix if we can manage? \\n\\nIs it a big idea worth an entire cycle? Would we redesign what we \\n\\nalready have to accommodate it? Will we only consider it if we can \\n\\nimplement it as a minor tweak?\\n\\nWe call this the appetite. You can think of the appetite as a time \\n\\nbudget for a standard team size. We usually set the appetite in  \\n\\ntwo sizes:\\n\\n•  Small Batch: This is a project that a team of one designer and \\n\\none or two programmers can build in one or two weeks. We \\n\\nbatch these together into a six week cycle (more on that later).\\n\\n•  Big Batch: This project takes the same-size team a full six-weeks.\\n\\nIn rare cases where the scope is so big that a six-week project isn’t \\n\\nconceivable, we’ll try to hammer it down by narrowing the problem \\n\\ndefinition. If we still can’t shrink the scope, we’ll break off a mean-', 'ingful part of the project that we can shape to a six-week appetite.\\n\\nFixed time, variable scope\\nAn appetite is completely different from an estimate. Estimates \\n\\nstart with a design and end with a number. Appetites start with a \\n\\nnumber and end with a design. We use the appetite as a creative \\n\\nconstraint on the design process.\\n\\nC H A P T E R   3   -   SE T   BO U N D A R I E S\\n\\n2 9\\n\\n\\x0cThis principle, called “fixed time, variable scope,” is key to success-\\n\\nfully defining and shipping projects. Take this book for an example. \\n\\nIt’s hard to ship a book when you can always add more, explain \\n\\nmore, or improve what’s already there. When you have a dead-\\n\\nline, all of a sudden you have to make decisions. With one week \\n\\nleft, I can choose between fixing typos or adding a new section to \\n\\na chapter. That’s the tension between time, quality, and scope. I \\n\\ndon’t want to release a book with embarrassing typos, so I’ll choose \\n\\nto reduce the scope by leaving out the extra section. Without the \\n\\npressure of the fixed deadline, I wouldn’t make the trade-off. If the ', 'scope wasn’t variable, I’d have to include the extra section. Then \\n\\nthere’d be no time to fix the quality issues.\\n\\nWe apply this principle at each stage of the process, from shaping \\n\\npotential projects to building and shipping them. First, the appetite \\n\\nconstrains what kind of a solution we design during the shaping \\n\\nprocess. Later, when we hand the work to a team, the fixed time box \\n\\npushes them to make decisions about what is core to the project \\n\\nand what is peripheral or unnecessary.\\n\\n“Good” is relative\\nThere’s no absolute definition of “the best” solution. The best is \\n\\nrelative to your constraints. Without a time limit, there’s always a \\n\\nbetter version. The ultimate meal might be a ten course dinner. But \\n\\nwhen you’re hungry and in a hurry, a hot dog is perfect.\\n\\nThe amount of time we set for our appetite is going to lead us to dif-\\n\\nferent solutions. We could model a whole set of database columns \\n\\nin the fancy version, or just provide a flat textarea in the simple \\n\\nversion. We could redesign the main landing page to accommo-\\n\\ndate a new feature, or we could push it back to a screen with fewer \\n\\n3 0\\n\\n\\x0cdesign constraints. We can only judge what is a “good” solution in ', 'the context of how much time we want to spend and how important \\n\\nit is.\\n\\nResponding to raw ideas\\nOur default response to any idea that comes up should be: “In-\\n\\nteresting. Maybe some day.” In other words, a very soft “no” that \\n\\nleaves all our options open. We don’t put it in a backlog. We give \\n\\nit space so we can learn whether it’s really important and what it \\n\\nmight entail.\\n\\nIt’s too early to say “yes” or “no” on first contact. Even if we’re \\n\\nexcited about it, we shouldn’t make a commitment that we don’t \\n\\nyet understand. We need to do work on the idea before it’s shaped \\n\\nenough to bet resources on. If we always say “yes” to incoming \\n\\nrequests we’ll end up with a giant pile of work that only grows.\\n\\nIt’s important to keep a cool manner and a bit of a poker face. We \\n\\ndon’t want to shut down an idea that we don’t understand. New in-\\n\\nformation might come in tomorrow that makes us see it differently. \\n\\nOn the other hand, showing too much enthusiasm right away can \\n\\nset expectations that this thing is going to happen. We may not be \\n\\nable to commit to it once we’ve put it into context with everything ', 'else we want to do.\\n\\nNarrow down the problem\\nIn addition to setting the appetite, we usually need to narrow down \\n\\nour understanding of the problem.\\n\\nWe once had a customer ask us for more complex permission \\n\\nrules. It could easily have taken six weeks to build the change she \\n\\nwanted. Instead of taking the request at face value, we dug deeper. \\n\\nC H A P T E R   3   -   SE T   BO U N D A R I E S\\n\\n3 1\\n\\n\\x0cIt turned out that someone had archived a file without knowing the \\n\\nfile would disappear for everyone else using the system. Instead of \\n\\ncreating a rule to prevent some people from archiving, we realized \\n\\nwe could put a warning on the archive action itself that explains \\n\\nthe impact. That’s a one-day change instead of a six-week project.\\n\\nAnother example is the “calendar view” from the previous chapter. \\n\\nEveryone knows what a calendar view is. But unpacking it revealed \\n\\ntons of unknowns and decisions that would drastically affect the \\n\\nscope. If we only want to spend six weeks instead of six months \\n\\nbuilding a huge calendar, how do we narrow it down?\\n\\nIn that case we flip from asking “What could we build?” to “What’s ', 'really going wrong?” Sure, a calendar sounds nice. But what is \\n\\ndriving the request? At what point specifically does someone’s \\n\\ncurrent workflow break down without this thing they’re asking for?\\n\\nCase study: Defining “calendar”\\nIn the case of the calendar request, we called a customer who asked \\n\\nfor this feature. Instead of asking her why she wants a calendar and \\n\\nwhat it should look like, we asked her when she wanted a calendar. \\n\\nWhat was she doing when the thought occurred to ask for it?\\n\\nShe told us she worked in an office with a big calendar drawn on a \\n\\nchalkboard wall. Her officemates marked when they were meeting \\n\\nclients in the handful of meeting rooms on the calendar. One \\n\\nday she was working from home. A client called and asked her to \\n\\nschedule a meeting. She had to drive to the office to look at the wall \\n\\ncalendar. Traffic was terrible along the way, and in the end there \\n\\nwasn’t a free space that worked for her client. She could have saved \\n\\nan hour in traffic and a lot of frustration if she had been able to \\n\\ncheck for open spots on the calendar from her computer at home.\\n\\n3 2\\n\\n\\x0cThe insight wasn’t “computerize the calendar”—that’s obvious. ', 'What we learned was that “see free spaces” was the important \\n\\nthing for this use case, not “do everything a calendar does.”\\n\\nThis story, and others like it, gave us a specific baseline to design \\n\\nagainst. Basecamp had an agenda view of events. It worked for \\n\\nlisting major deadlines and milestones but it wasn’t good for re-\\n\\nsource scheduling because you couldn’t see empty spaces on it. We \\n\\nnarrowed down the need from “do everything a calendar does” to \\n\\n“help me see free spaces so I can figure out when to  \\n\\nschedule something.”\\n\\nWe didn’t have a solution yet. But now we felt like we had a \\n\\nproblem that was specific enough to spark an idea that could fit \\n\\nwithin our appetite. This led us to the simpler “Dot Grid” concept \\n\\nfrom the last chapter.\\n\\nWhat if we can’t figure out a specific pain point or use case? Our \\n\\nappetite can also tell us how much research is worthwhile. If it’s \\n\\nnot critical now and we can’t get our hands around the problem, \\n\\nwe’ll walk away from it and work on something else. Maybe in the \\n\\nfuture a new request or story will pop up that gives us better insight \\n\\ninto the problem.\\n\\nWatch out for grab-bags', '\\nsigns” or “refactorings” that aren’t driven by a single problem or \\n\\nuse case. When someone proposes something like “redesign the \\n\\nFiles section,” that’s a grab-bag, not a project. It’s going to be very \\n\\nhard to figure out what it means, where it starts, and where it ends. \\n\\nHere’s a more productive starting point: “We need to rethink the \\n\\nFiles section because sharing multiple files takes too many steps.” \\n\\nC H A P T E R   3   -   SE T   BO U N D A R I E S\\n\\n3 3\\n\\n\\x0cNow we can start asking: What’s not working? In what context are \\n\\nthere too many steps? What parts of the existing design can stay the \\n\\nsame and what parts need to change?\\n\\nA tell-tale sign of a grab-bag is the “2.0” label. We made the mistake \\n\\nin the past of kicking off a “Files 2.0” project without really consid-\\n\\nering what that meant. Our excitement about improving a huge part \\n\\nof our app got the better of us. We know there were a lot of prob-\\n\\nlems with our Files feature, but we didn’t ask ourselves what spe-', 'cifically we were going to do. The project turned out to be a mess \\n\\nbecause we didn’t know what “done” looked like. We recovered by \\n\\nsplitting the project into smaller projects, like “Better file previews” \\n\\nand “Custom folder colors.” We set appetites and clear expectations \\n\\non each project and shipped them successfully.\\n\\nBoundaries in place\\nWhen we have all three things—a raw idea, an appetite, and a \\n\\nnarrow problem definition—we’re ready to move to the next step \\n\\nand define the elements of a solution.\\n\\n3 4\\n\\n\\x0cFind the Elements\\n\\nNow that we have the constraints of an appetite and the problem \\n\\nwe’re solving, it’s time to get from an idea in words to the elements \\n\\nof a software solution. There could be dozens of different ways to \\n\\napproach the solution for a problem. So it’s important that we can \\n\\nmove fast and cover a lot of different ideas without getting  \\n\\ndragged down.\\n\\nMove at the right speed\\nTwo things enable us to move at the right speed at this stage.\\n\\nFirst, we need to have the right people—or nobody—in the room. \\n\\nEither we’re working alone or with a trusted partner who can keep \\n\\npace with us. Someone we can speak with in shorthand, who has ', 'the same background knowledge, and who we can be frank with as \\n\\nwe jump between ideas.\\n\\nSecond, we need to avoid the wrong level of detail in the drawings \\n\\nC H A P T E R   4   -   FI N D  T H E   EL E M E N T S\\n\\n3 5\\n\\n\\x0cand sketches. If we start with wireframes or specific visual layouts, \\n\\nwe’ll get stuck on unnecessary details and we won’t be able to \\n\\nexplore as broadly as we need to.\\n\\nThe challenge here is to be concrete enough to make progress on \\n\\na specific solution without getting dragged down into fine details. \\n\\nThe questions we’re trying to answer are:\\n\\n•  Where in the current system does the new thing fit?\\n\\n•  How do you get to it?\\n\\n•  What are the key components or interactions?\\n\\n•  Where does it take you?\\n\\nTo stay on the right level of detail and capture our thoughts as \\n\\nthey come, we work by hand using a couple of prototyping tech-\\n\\nniques: breadboarding and fat marker sketches. These allow us to \\n\\nquickly draw different versions of entire flows so we can debate the \\n\\npros and cons of each approach and stay aligned with what we’re \\n\\ntalking about as we go.', 'Breadboarding\\nWe borrow a concept from electrical engineering to help us design \\n\\nat the right level of abstraction. A breadboard is an electrical engi-\\n\\nneering prototype that has all the components and wiring of a real \\n\\ndevice but no industrial design.\\n\\n3 6\\n\\n\\x0cDeciding to include an indicator light and a rotary knob is very dif-\\n\\nferent from debating the chassis material, whether the knob should \\n\\ngo to the left of the light or the right, how sharp the corners should \\n\\nbe, and so on.\\n\\nSimilarly, we can sketch and discuss the key components and con-\\n\\nnections of an interface idea without specifying a particular visual \\n\\ndesign. To do that, we can use a simple shorthand. There are three \\n\\nbasic things we’ll draw:\\n\\n1. Places: These are things you can navigate to, like \\n\\nscreens, dialogs, or menus that pop up.\\n\\n2. Affordances: These are things the user can act on, like \\n\\nbuttons and fields. We consider interface copy to \\n\\nbe an affordance, too. Reading it is an act that gives \\n\\nthe user information for subsequent actions.\\n\\n3. Connection lines: These show how the affor-\\n\\ndances take the user from place to place.\\n\\nWe’ll use words for everything instead of pictures. The important ', 'things are the components we’re identifying and their connections. \\n\\nThey allow us to play out an idea and judge if the sequence of \\n\\nactions serves the use case we’re trying to solve.\\n\\nExample\\n\\nSuppose our product is an invoicing tool. We’re considering adding \\n\\na new “Autopay” feature to enable our customers’ customers to pay \\n\\nfuture invoices automatically.\\n\\nHow do you turn Autopay on? What’s involved? We can pick a start-\\n\\ning point and say that the customer landed on an invoice. That’s\\n\\nC H A P T E R   4   -   FI N D  T H E   EL E M E N T S\\n\\n3 7\\n\\n\\x0c our first place. We draw it by writing the name of the place and \\n\\nunderlining it.\\n\\nOn the invoice, we’re thinking we could add a new button to “Turn \\n\\non Autopay.” That’s an affordance. Affordances go below the line to \\n\\nindicate they can be found at that place.\\n\\nWhere does that button go? Some place for setting up the Autopay. \\n\\nWe don’t have to specify whether it’s a separate screen or a pop up \\n\\nmodal or what. From a what’s-connected-to-what standpoint (the ', 'topology) it’s all the same. Let’s draw a connection line from the \\n\\nbutton to the Setup Autopay screen.\\n\\nNow we can talk about what belongs on that screen. Do we ask for \\n\\na credit card here? Is there a card on file already? What about ACH \\n\\nor other payment methods?\\n\\nJust figuring out what to write under the bar starts to provoke \\n\\n3 8\\n\\n\\x0cdebates and discussions about what to build.\\n\\nAs we think it through, we decide we should ask for credit card \\n\\ndetails here and show the logo of the financial institution (an \\n\\naspect of the domain in this specific product).\\n\\nStraightforward enough. But wait — did we actually pay the origi-\\n\\nnal invoice or not? Hm. Now we have both functional and interface \\n\\nquestions. What does enabling Autopay actually do? Does it apply \\n\\nonly for the future or does paying with Autopay the first time also \\n\\npay the current invoice? And where do we explain this behavior? \\n\\nWe’re starting to have deeper questions and discussions prompted \\n\\nby just a few words and arrows in the breadboard.\\n\\nSince we’re using such a lightweight notation, and we aren’t \\n\\nbogged down with wireframes, we can quickly jump around and ', 'entertain different possibilities.\\n\\nWe could add an option to the Setup screen…\\n\\nC H A P T E R   4   -   FI N D  T H E   EL E M E N T S\\n\\n3 9\\n\\n\\x0cBut now we’re complicating the responsibilities of the confirma-\\n\\ntion screen. We’re going to need to show a receipt if you pay your \\n\\nbalance now. Should the confirmation have a condition to some-\\n\\ntimes show a receipt of the amount just paid?\\n\\nHow about an entirely different approach. Instead of starting on \\n\\nan Invoice, we make Autopay an option when making a payment. \\n\\nThis way there’s no ambiguity about whether the current amount is \\n\\nbeing paid. We could add an extra “Autopay was enabled” callout \\n\\nto the existing payment confirmation page.\\n\\nSketching this out reminded us that the current payment form sup-\\n\\nports ACH in addition to credit card. We discuss and confirm that \\n\\nwe can use ACH too.\\n\\nWhat about after Autopay is enabled? How does the customer turn \\n\\nit off? Up to this point, many customers in the system didn’t have \\n\\nusernames or passwords. They followed tokenized links to pay the \\n\\ninvoices one by one. One might naturally assume that now that the ', 'customer has something like Autopay, they need a username and \\n\\npassword and some landing place to go manage it.\\n\\nThe team in this case decided that adding the username/password \\n\\n4 0\\n\\n\\x0cflows was too much scope for their appetite at the time. Reflecting \\n\\nstrategically on what they knew about their customers, they thought \\n\\nit would be quite alright if the invoicer’s customers had to reach out \\n\\nto the invoicer and ask them to turn off the Autopay. In that case we \\n\\ncould add a single option to disable Autopay in the customer detail \\n\\npage that we already offered to invoicers. We drew out the flow  \\n\\nlike this:\\n\\nThis example illustrates the level of thinking and the speed of \\n\\nmovement to aim for during the breadboarding phase. Writing out \\n\\nthe flows confronts us with questions we didn’t originally think of \\n\\nand stimulates design ideas without distracting us with unimport-\\n\\nant visual choices.\\n\\nOnce we get to a place where we play through the use case and the \\n\\nflow seems like a fit, we’ve got the elements we need to move on to \\n\\nstart defining the project more clearly. We’re getting more concrete \\n\\nwhile still leaving out a huge amount of detail.\\n\\nFat marker sketches\\nSometimes the idea we have in mind is a visual one. Breadboarding ', 'would just miss the point because the 2D arrangement of elements \\n\\nis the fundamental problem. In that case, we still don’t want to \\n\\nC H A P T E R   4   -   FI N D  T H E   EL E M E N T S\\n\\n4 1\\n\\n\\x0cwaste time on wireframes or unnecessary fidelity. Instead we use \\n\\nfat marker sketches.\\n\\nA fat marker sketch is a sketch made with such broad strokes that \\n\\nadding detail is difficult or impossible. We originally did this with \\n\\nlarger tipped Sharpie markers on paper. Today we also do it on \\n\\niPads with the pen size set to a large diameter.\\n\\nHere’s an example. We found ourselves often creating fake to-dos \\n\\nin our Basecamp to-do lists that acted as dividers. We’d create an \\n\\nitem like “––– Needs testing –––“ and put items below it. We had \\n\\nthe idea to make some kind of official divider feature in our to-do \\n\\ntool to turn the workaround into a first class function of to-do lists.\\n\\nWe had to work out what the implications of adding a divider were. \\n\\nWe came up with a rough idea that adding a divider separates the \\n\\nlist into “loose” to-dos above the divider and “grouped” to-dos ', 'below. Adding subsequent dividers adds more groups below the \\n\\n“loose” items at the top.\\n\\n4 2\\n\\n\\x0cWe could add items via some affordance within each group, includ-\\n\\ning the “loose” group on top.\\n\\nWe were a little concerned the add buttons might break up the \\n\\ngestalt of the list, and the groups might all separate too much from \\n\\nthe lists on the page. We talked about possibilities to place the \\n\\n“add” affordance inside of a menu that we already had to the left of \\n\\neach to-do item.\\n\\nC H A P T E R   4   -   FI N D  T H E   EL E M E N T S\\n\\n4 3\\n\\n\\x0cThis notation is much less constraining than breadboards, which \\n\\nhas downsides. We might sketch a sidebar and get attached to a \\n\\nlayout element like that even though it’s not a core element. But as \\n\\nlong as we keep an eye on that we’re still far better off than if we get \\n\\nsucked into the weeds by creating wireframes too early.\\n\\nIt may seem a little silly to call fat marker sketches a technique or \\n\\na tool. The reason for calling them out is we too easily skip ahead \\n\\nto the wrong level of fidelity. Giving this rough early stage a name ', 'and using a specific tool for it helps us to segment our own creative \\n\\nprocess and make sure we aren’t jumping ahead to detail a specific \\n\\nidea when we haven’t surveyed the field enough.\\n\\nElements are the output\\nIn the case of the Autopay example, we ended up with some  \\n\\nclear elements:\\n\\n•  A new “use this to Autopay?” checkbox on \\n\\nthe existing “Pay an invoice” screen\\n\\n•  A “disable Autopay” option on the invoicer’s side\\n\\nFor the To-Do Groups project, the elements were:\\n\\n•  Loose to-dos above the first group belong directly to the parent\\n\\n•  Grouped to-dos appear below the loose to-dos\\n\\n•  We’d like to try an add affordance within each section, but \\n\\nif that doesn’t work visually, we’re ok with relying on \\n\\nthe action menu for inserting to-dos into position.\\n\\n4 4\\n\\n\\x0cSimilarly, when we sketched the simplified solution for rendering \\n\\nevents on a calendar grid, we used the fat marker approach.\\n\\nThis enabled us to work out the main elements of the solution:\\n\\n•  A 2-up monthly calendar grid\\n\\n•  Dots for events, no spanned pills\\n\\n•  Agenda-style list of events below that scrolls ', 'an event into view when you tap a dot\\n\\nThis list of elements is extremely narrow and specific compared \\n\\nto “monthly calendar.” Exactly the kind of narrowing we hope to \\n\\naccomplish through the shaping process.\\n\\nC H A P T E R   4   -   FI N D  T H E   EL E M E N T S\\n\\n4 5\\n\\n\\x0cRoom for designers\\nLater, when it’s time to involve a designer, you don’t want to have to \\n\\nsay “I know I drew it like this but ignore that…”. Regardless of what \\n\\nyou say, any specific mockups are going to bias what other people \\n\\ndo after you—especially if you’re in a higher position than them. \\n\\nThey’ll take every detail in the initial mockups as direction even \\n\\nthough you didn’t intend it.\\n\\nWorking at the right “level of abstraction” not only ensures we \\n\\nmove at the right speed, it also leaves this important room for cre-\\n\\nativity in the later stages.\\n\\nBy leaving details out, the breadboard and fat marker methods give \\n\\nroom to designers in subsequent phases of the project.\\n\\nThis is a theme of the shaping process. We’re making the project \\n\\nmore specific and concrete, but still leaving lots of space for deci-', 'sions and choices to be made later. This isn’t a spec. It’s more like \\n\\nthe boundaries and rules of a game. It could go in countless differ-\\n\\nent ways once it’s time to play.\\n\\nNot deliverable yet\\nThis step of shaping is still very much in your private sphere. It’s \\n\\nnormal for the artifacts at this point — on the wall or in your note-\\n\\nbook — to be more or less indecipherable to anybody who wasn’t \\n\\nthere with you.\\n\\nWe’ve gone from a cloudy idea, like “autopay” or “to-do groups,” \\n\\nto a specific approach and a handful of concrete elements. But the \\n\\nform we have is still very rough and mostly in outline.\\n\\nWhat we’ve done is landed on an approach for how to solve the \\n\\n4 6\\n\\n\\x0cproblem. But there may be some significant unknowns or things we \\n\\nneed to address before we’d consider this safe to hand off to a team \\n\\nto build successfully.\\n\\nThe next step is to do some stress-testing and de-risking. We want \\n\\nto check for holes and challenges that could hinder the project from \\n\\nshipping within the fixed time appetite that we have in mind for it.\\n\\nAfter that we’ll see how to wrap up the shaped concept into a ', 'write-up for pitching.\\n\\nNo conveyor belt\\nAlso keep in mind that, at this stage, we could walk away from the \\n\\nproject. We haven’t bet on it. We haven’t made any commitments or \\n\\npromises about it. What we’ve done is added value to the raw idea \\n\\nby making it more actionable. We’ve gotten closer to a good option \\n\\nthat we can later lobby for when it’s time to allocate resources.\\n\\nC H A P T E R   4   -   FI N D  T H E   EL E M E N T S\\n\\n4 7\\n\\n\\x0cRisks and Rabbit Holes\\n\\nRemember that we’re shaping work for a fixed time window. We \\n\\nmay trust from our experience that the elements we fleshed out in \\n\\nthe previous chapter are buildable within the appetite (six weeks). \\n\\nBut we need to look closer, because all it takes is one hole in the \\n\\nconcept to derail that. Suppose we bet on the project and a team \\n\\ntakes it on. If they run into an unanticipated problem that takes \\n\\ntwo weeks to solve, they just burned a third of the budget!\\n\\nEven worse, sometimes you run into problems that don’t just delay \\n\\nthe project—they have no apparent solution. We once bet on a ', 'project to redesign the way we present projects with clients on \\n\\nBasecamp’s home screen. We assumed the designer would figure it \\n\\nout; we didn’t do the work in the shaping phase to validate that a \\n\\nviable approach existed. Once the project started, it turned out to \\n\\nbe a much harder problem than we expected. None of us were able \\n\\nto find a suitable design solution within the six weeks we budgeted. \\n\\nWe ended up abandoning the project and rethinking it later.\\n\\n4 8\\n\\n\\x0cOf course there will always be unknowns. That’s why we apply the \\n\\nmany practices in Part Three so that teams tackle the right prob-\\n\\nlems in the right order, leaving room for the unexpected. But that \\n\\ndoesn’t mean we shouldn’t look for the pitfalls we can find up front \\n\\nand eliminate them before betting on the project. Before we con-\\n\\nsider it safe to bet on, a shaped project should be as free of holes  \\n\\nas possible.\\n\\nDifferent categories of risk\\nIn terms of risk, well-shaped work looks like a thin-tailed probabil-\\n\\nity distribution. There’s a slight chance it could take an extra week \\n\\nbut, beyond that, the elements of the solution are defined enough \\n\\nand familiar enough that there’s no reason it should drag on longer  ', 'than that.\\n\\nHowever, if there are any rabbit holes in the shaping—technical un-\\n\\nknowns, unsolved design problems, or misunderstood interdepen-\\n\\ndencies—the project could take multiple times the original appetite \\n\\nto complete. The right tail stretches out.\\n\\nC H A P T E R   5   -   RI S K S  A N D   RA B B I T   HO L E S\\n\\n4 9\\n\\n\\x0cWe want to remove the unknowns and tricky problems from the \\n\\nproject so that our probability is as thin-tailed as possible. That \\n\\nmeans a project with independent, well-understood parts that \\n\\nassemble together in known ways.\\n\\nLook for rabbit holes\\nFleshing out the elements of the solution was a fast-moving, ex-\\n\\nploratory process. It was more breadth than depth. In this step, we \\n\\nslow down and look critically at what we came up with. Did we miss \\n\\nanything? Are we making technical assumptions that aren’t fair?\\n\\nOne way to analyze the solution is to walk through a use case in \\n\\nslow motion. Given the solution we sketched, how exactly would \\n\\na user get from the starting point to the end? Slowing down and \\n\\nplaying it out can reveal gaps or missing pieces that we need  ', 'to design.\\n\\nThen we should also question the viability of each part we think we \\n\\nsolved. We ask ourselves questions like:\\n\\n•  Does this require new technical work we’ve never done before?\\n\\n•  Are we making assumptions about how the parts fit together?\\n\\n5 0\\n\\n\\x0c•  Are we assuming a design solution exists that \\n\\nwe couldn’t come up with ourselves?\\n\\n•  Is there a hard decision we should settle in \\n\\nadvance so it doesn’t trip up the team?\\n\\nCase study: Patching a hole\\nFor example, when we defined the To-Do Groups project, we intro-\\n\\nduced the idea of dividers in the to-do list:\\n\\nWe liked the idea of the dividers, and the logic of loose versus \\n\\ngrouped to-dos made sense to us. But when we looked closer we \\n\\nrealized that we didn’t address how to display completed items. In \\n\\nthe pre-existing design, the latest few completed items displayed \\n\\nbelow the list. Should we now render completed items at the \\n\\nbottom of each group instead of the list? Or should we continue to \\n\\nshow completed items at the bottom, and repeat the same set of \\n\\ndividers within the completed items section? Should we reconsider \\n\\nhow we handle completed items entirely?\\n\\nC H A P T E R   5   -   RI S K S  A N D   RA B B I T   HO L E S', '5 1\\n\\n\\x0cThis was a hole in the concept. If we didn’t address it, we’d be \\n\\npushing a deep design problem down to the team and unreason-\\n\\nably asking them to find a solution under deadline. It’s not respon-\\n\\nsible to give the team a tangled knot of interdependencies and then \\n\\nask them to untangle it within a short fixed time window.\\n\\nWe knew from experience that changing the way completed to-dos \\n\\nrender has lots of complicated implications in user experience, navi-\\n\\ngation, and performance. To remove uncertainty in the project, we \\n\\ndecided to dictate a solution in the shaped concept. We would leave \\n\\nthe completed items exactly as they worked previously. Instead of \\n\\ngrouping or segmenting them, we would just append the name of \\n\\nthe group to each completed item. It would be a little messy, but we \\n\\njustified the trade-off: it drastically simplified the problem, and we \\n\\ncould still show completed items from a group on the group’s  \\n\\ndetail page.\\n\\n5 2\\n\\n\\x0cThis is the kind of trade-off that’s difficult to make when you’re \\n\\nworking inside the cycle under pressure. There are lots of reasons \\n\\nwhy a different design or a deeper reconsideration of completed ', 'to-dos would be objectively better. Why not try rendering them \\n\\ninside each group? A designer could reasonably think, “Maybe if I \\n\\nexperiment with the styling a little more I can make them blend in \\n\\nbetter.” They could easily waste a few days of the very few weeks \\n\\nthey have going down a dead end.\\n\\nAs shapers, we’re thinking less about the ultimate design and more \\n\\nabout basic quality and risk. With the compromised concept we \\n\\nget to keep all the elements that made the project worth doing—the \\n\\ngroups of incomplete items—and we get to cut off a big tail of risk.\\n\\nNext, when we write the pitch for this project, we’ll point out this \\n\\nspecific “patch” as part of the concept. That way nobody down the \\n\\nline will get tripped up on it.\\n\\nDeclare out of bounds\\nSince everyone on the team wants to do their best work, they will of \\n\\ncourse look for all the use cases to cover and consider them neces-\\n\\nsary. As the team gets more comfortable with scope hammering (see \\n\\nDecide When to Stop), this improves. But it’s still a good idea to call \\n\\nout any cases you specifically aren’t supporting to keep the project \\n\\nwell within the appetite.\\n\\nFor example, we worked on an idea for notifying groups of people ', 'in Basecamp. Rather than checking off five programmers one by \\n\\none, you could just click “Programmers” and they’d be selected \\n\\nfor notification. As we looked at the product, we saw tons of places \\n\\nwhere this kind of behavior might make sense. If we let you choose \\n\\na group when posting a message, why not when assigning a to-do, \\n\\nC H A P T E R   5   -   RI S K S  A N D   RA B B I T   HO L E S\\n\\n5 3\\n\\n\\x0cor mentioning people in the chat room?\\n\\nWe decided for the purpose of the project that the core value was \\n\\nnarrowing down who to notify about a message. We explicitly \\n\\nmarked off the other cases as “out of bounds” for the project and \\n\\nfocused on the win we wanted: a faster flow for posting messages.\\n\\nCut back\\nThere may be parts of the solution we got excited about during the \\n\\nsketching phase that aren’t really necessary. When we designed the \\n\\nTo-Do Groups feature, we thought it would be great to color-code \\n\\ngroups. No doubt the page would look more interesting with col-\\n\\nor-coded group labels, and the feature might be more useful too. \\n\\nBut we decided to flag this as unnecessary and cut it from the core ', 'of the project. We could mention it to the team as a nice-to-have, \\n\\nbut everyone should start from the assumption that the feature is \\n\\nvaluable without it.\\n\\nPresent to technical experts\\nUp to this point shaping has been a closed-door activity. Before \\n\\nyou’re ready to write up the idea to share more widely, you might \\n\\nneed input on some parts of the concept you aren’t completely sure \\n\\nabout. There may be a technical assumption that you need to verify \\n\\nwith someone who understands the code better. Or perhaps you \\n\\nwant to make sure that usage data doesn’t contradict an assump-\\n\\ntion you’re making about current customer behavior.\\n\\nThis is a good time to grab some technical experts and walk \\n\\nthem through the idea. Communicate that this is just an idea. It’s \\n\\nsomething you’re shaping as a potential bet, not something that’s \\n\\ncoming down the pipe yet. The mood is friendly-conspiratorial: \\n\\n5 4\\n\\n\\x0c“Here’s something I’m thinking about… but I’m not ready to show \\n\\nanybody yet… what do you think?”\\n\\nBeware the simple question: “Is this possible?” In software, ev-\\n\\nerything is possible but nothing is free. We want to find out if it’s ', 'possible within the appetite we’re shaping for. Instead of asking “is \\n\\nit possible to do X?” ask “is X possible in 6-weeks?” That’s a very \\n\\ndifferent question.\\n\\nTalk through the constraints of how this is a good solution given \\n\\nthe appetite, so they’re partners in keeping the project at the size \\n\\nyou intend. And emphasize that you’re looking for risks that could \\n\\nblow up the project. It’s not just a “what do you think” conversa-\\n\\ntion—we’re really hunting for time bombs that might blow up the \\n\\nproject once it’s committed to a team.\\n\\nTry to keep the clay wet. Rather than writing up a document or \\n\\ncreating a slideshow, invite them to a whiteboard and redraw the \\n\\nelements as you worked them out earlier, building up the concept \\n\\nfrom the beginning. Stick completely to the concept you already \\n\\nworked out to get feedback on the work you’ve already done. Then \\n\\nonce you’ve covered the work you already did, open it up and invite \\n\\nthem to suggest revisions. Having seen this concept, do they have \\n\\nany insights about how to drastically simplify or approach the \\n\\nproblem differently?\\n\\nDepending on how the conversation goes, you may either have val-\\n\\nidated your approach or discovered some problems that send you ', 'back for another round of shaping.\\n\\nC H A P T E R   5   -   RI S K S  A N D   RA B B I T   HO L E S\\n\\n5 5\\n\\n\\x0cDe-risked and ready to write up\\nAt the end of this stage, we have the elements of the solution, \\n\\npatches for potential rabbit holes, and fences around areas we’ve \\n\\ndeclared out of bounds. We’ve gone from a roughly formed solution \\n\\nwith potential risk in it to a solid idea that we now hope to bet on in \\n\\nthe future.\\n\\nThat means we’re ready to make the transition from privately \\n\\nshaping and getting feedback from an inner-circle to presenting the \\n\\nidea at the betting table. To do that, we write it up in a form that \\n\\ncommunicates the boundaries and spells out the solution so that \\n\\npeople with less context will be able to understand and evaluate it. \\n\\nThis “pitch” will be the document that we use to lobby for resources, \\n\\ncollect wider feedback if necessary, or simply capture the idea for \\n\\nwhen the time is more ripe in the future.\\n\\n5 6\\n\\n\\x0cWrite the Pitch\\n\\nWe’ve got the elements of a solution now, and we’ve de-risked our \\n\\nconcept to the point that we’re confident it’s a good option to give a ', 'team. But the concept is still in our heads or in some hard-to-deci-\\n\\npher drawings on the whiteboard or our notebook. Now we need to \\n\\nput the concept into a form that other people will be able to under-\\n\\nstand, digest, and respond to.\\n\\nThis is where we say “Okay, this is ready to write up as a pitch.” In \\n\\nthis chapter, we’ll walk through the ingredients of a pitch and show \\n\\nsome fully worked out examples from real projects at Basecamp.\\n\\nThe purpose of the pitch is to present a good potential bet. It’s basi-\\n\\ncally a presentation. The ingredients are all the things that we need \\n\\nto both capture the work done so far and present it in a form that \\n\\nwill enable the people who schedule projects to make an  \\n\\ninformed bet.\\n\\nC H A P T E R   6   -   WR I T E  T H E   PI T C H\\n\\n5 7\\n\\n\\x0cThere are five ingredients that we always want to include in a pitch:\\n\\n1. Problem — The raw idea, a use case, or something \\n\\nwe’ve seen that motivates us to work on this\\n\\n2. Appetite — How much time we want to spend \\n\\nand how that constrains the solution', '3. Solution — The core elements we came up with, presented \\n\\nin a form that’s easy for people to immediately understand\\n\\n4. Rabbit holes — Details about the solution \\n\\nworth calling out to avoid problems\\n\\n5. No-gos — Anything specifically excluded from the concept: \\n\\nfunctionality or use cases we intentionally aren’t cover-\\n\\ning to fit the appetite or make the problem tractable\\n\\nIngredient 1. Problem\\nIt’s critical to always present both a problem and a solution to-\\n\\ngether. It sounds like an obvious point but it’s surprising how often \\n\\nteams, our own included, jump to a solution with the assumption \\n\\nthat it’s obvious why it’s a good idea to build this thing.\\n\\nDiving straight into “what to build”—the solution—is dangerous. \\n\\nYou don’t establish any basis for discussing whether this solution \\n\\nis good or bad without a problem. “Add tabs to the iPad app” might \\n\\nbe attractive to UI designers, but what’s to prevent the discussion \\n\\nfrom devolving into a long debate about different UI approaches? \\n\\nWithout a specific problem, there’s no test of fitness to judge \\n\\nwhether one solution is better than the other.\\n\\nEstablishing the problem also lets us have a clearer conversation \\n\\nlater when it’s time to pitch the idea or bet on it. The solution might ', '5 8\\n\\n\\x0cbe perfect, but what if the problem only happens to customers who \\n\\nare known to be a poor fit to the product? We could spend six weeks \\n\\non an ingenious solution that only benefits a small percentage of \\n\\ncustomers known to have low retention. We want to be able to sep-\\n\\narate out that discussion about the demand so we don’t spend time \\n\\non a good solution that doesn’t benefit the right people.\\n\\nHow far you have to go to spell out the problem will depend on \\n\\nhow much context you share with the people reading the write-up. \\n\\nThe best problem definition consists of a single specific story that \\n\\nshows why the status quo doesn’t work. This gives you a base-\\n\\nline to test fitness against. People will be able to weigh the solu-\\n\\ntion against this specific problem—or other solutions if a debate \\n\\nensues—and judge whether or not that story has a better outcome \\n\\nwith the new solution swapped in.\\n\\nIngredient 2. Appetite\\nYou can think of the appetite as another part of the problem defini-\\n\\ntion. Not only do we want to solve this use case, we want to come \\n\\nup with a way to do it in six weeks, not three months, or—in the \\n\\ncase of a small batch project—two weeks, not the whole six weeks.', 'Stating the appetite in the pitch prevents unproductive conversa-\\n\\ntions. There’s always a better solution. The question is, if we only \\n\\ncare enough to spend two weeks on this now, how does this specific \\n\\nsolution look?\\n\\nAnybody can suggest expensive and complicated solutions. It takes \\n\\nwork and design insight to get to a simple idea that fits in a small \\n\\ntime box. Stating the appetite and embracing it as a constraint \\n\\nturns everyone into a partner in that process.\\n\\nC H A P T E R   6   -   WR I T E  T H E   PI T C H\\n\\n5 9\\n\\n\\x0cIngredient 3. Solution\\nLike solutions with no problems, sometimes companies bet on \\n\\nproblems with no solution. “We really need to make it easier to find \\n\\nthings on the messages section. Customers are complaining  \\n\\nabout it.”\\n\\nThat’s not ready to pitch or bet on. A problem without a solution is \\n\\nunshaped work. Giving it to a team means pushing research and \\n\\nexploration down to the wrong level, where the skillsets, time limit, \\n\\nand risk profile (thin vs.\\xa0heavy tailed) are all misaligned.\\n\\nIf the solution isn’t there, someone should go back and do the ', 'shaping work on the shaping track. It’s only ready to bet on when \\n\\nproblem, appetite, and solution come together. Then you can scru-\\n\\ntinize the fit between problem and solution and judge whether it’s a \\n\\ngood bet or not.\\n\\nHelp them see it\\nDuring the elements phase, it was critical to sketch ideas at the \\n\\nright level of abstraction so we didn’t slow down or lose any of the \\n\\nideas appearing at the corners of our brains and tips of our tongues.\\n\\nWe also need to draw at the right level of detail when we write the \\n\\npitch. Here the challenge is a little different. We have time to slow \\n\\ndown and prepare a proper presentation. We need to stay high level, \\n\\nbut add a little more concreteness than when we worked alone or \\n\\nwith a partner. People who read the pitch and look at the drawings \\n\\nwithout much context need to “get” the idea.\\n\\nWe need more concreteness, but we don’t want to over-specify the \\n\\ndesign with wireframes or high-fidelity mocks. They’ll box in the \\n\\ndesigners who do the work later. We also risk side-tracking the \\n\\n6 0\\n\\n\\x0cdiscussion into topics like color, proportions, or layout that have \\n\\nnothing to do with the actual shaping work we did.', 'At the same time, hand-written breadboards have a “you had to be \\n\\nthere” quality to them. To people who didn’t watch the breadboard \\n\\nunfold step by step, it can look like a soup of words and arrows.\\n\\nTherefore we need some techniques to help people see the idea \\n\\nwhile still not going too far into irrelevant details.\\n\\nEmbedded sketches\\n\\nSuppose your breadboard from the shaping session looked like this:\\n\\nPeople might have trouble visualizing where these new affordances \\n\\ngo on the Dashboard. We could sketch a new box on the Dashboard \\n\\nto make it clearer:\\n\\nC H A P T E R   6   -   WR I T E  T H E   PI T C H\\n\\n6 1\\n\\n\\x0cBut we’re still asking people to imagine too much. It’s worth the \\n\\ntrade-off to go one step down into fat-marker detail here.\\n\\nThis makes it easier to see what the elements are and evaluate how \\n\\nclearly the feature presents itself on the dashboard. The downside \\n\\nis we’ve gotten into some layout decisions that would have been \\n\\nnice to avoid. Designers should feel free to find a different design \\n\\nthan the box divided with a vertical line. We’d add a disclaimer \\n\\nhere in the pitch that reminds designers of the latitude they  ', 'should take.\\n\\nThis is an example of selectively getting into more visual detail \\n\\nbecause we need it to sell the concept. Fortunately, we won’t need \\n\\nto make as many visual decisions in other parts of the concept. This \\n\\nwas a “linchpin” part of the design that everybody had to see con-\\n\\ncretely in order to “get” it.\\n\\nAnnotated fat marker sketches\\n\\nSometimes ideas are inherently visual or a little too complicated to \\n\\nexpress in a schematic breadboard. Fat marker sketches can be very \\n\\neffective in a pitch; you just need to take more care to label  \\n\\nthem cleanly.\\n\\n6 2\\n\\n\\x0cRedrawing the sketch on an iPad—still with a fat brush size—works \\n\\nwell. You can use different colors to separate the labels from the \\n\\nmaterial parts of the sketch.\\n\\nOr you might add some call-outs to enable discussion of  \\n\\nspecific elements.\\n\\nC H A P T E R   6   -   WR I T E  T H E   PI T C H\\n\\n6 3\\n\\n\\x0cIngredient 4. Rabbit holes\\nSometimes addressing a rabbit hole just requires a few lines of \\n\\ntext. For example, in the Payment Form project above, the shapers \\n\\nwanted to call out a specific solution for how to create URLs. The ', 'URLs would never live on custom domains for v1 of the project. This \\n\\nis the kind of thing that’s not central to the concept, but spelling it \\n\\nout patches a potential rabbit hole.\\n\\nIngredient 5. No Gos\\nLastly if there’s anything we’re not doing in this concept, it’s \\n\\ngood to mention it here. In the case of the Payment Form project, \\n\\nthe team decided up front that they wouldn’t allow any kind of \\n\\nWYSIWYG editing of the form. Users would only be able to provide \\n\\na logo and customize the header text on a separate “customize” \\n\\npage. WYSIWYG might be better in some peoples’ eyes, but given \\n\\nthe appetite it was important to mark this as a no-go.\\n\\nExamples\\nHere are two examples of real pitches.\\n\\n6 4\\n\\n\\x0cThis pitch for grouping to-dos together starts by showing a work-\\n\\naround people are using in the current design. Then it sketches out \\n\\nall the main ideas for how to enable optional to-do groupings.\\n\\nTwo screenshots demonstrate the problem. Fat marker sketches describe  \\n\\nthe solution. Rabbit holes motivated some of the sketches. \\n\\nSee full size at basecamp.com/shapeup-todo-pitch.\\n\\nC H A P T E R   6   -   WR I T E  T H E   PI T C H', '6 5\\n\\n\\x0cThis pitch for changing how notifications work starts with two \\n\\nvideos to demonstrate the problem. The black boxes toward the end \\n\\nare a visualization of user behavior data that supports a decision in \\n\\nthe pitch.\\n\\nTwo videos show the problem. A fat marker sketch and a breadboard describe \\n\\nthe solution. The black boxes contain data visualizations that support trade-offs \\n\\nin the solution. See full size at basecamp.com/shapeup-groups-pitch.\\n\\n6 6\\n\\n\\x0cReady to present\\nThe next step will be to make the case that this pitch describes a bet \\n\\nworth making. This can happen in a couple ways.\\n\\nWe prefer asynchronous communication by default and escalate to \\n\\nreal-time only when necessary. This gives everyone the maximum \\n\\namount of time under their own control for doing real work. That \\n\\nmeans the first step for presenting a pitch is posting the write-up \\n\\nwith all the ingredients above somewhere that stakeholders can \\n\\nread it on their own time. This keeps the betting table short and \\n\\nproductive. In ideal conditions everyone has time to read the \\n\\npitches in advance. And if that isn’t possible in some cases, the \\n\\npitch is ready to pull up for a quick live sell.\\n\\nHow we do it in Basecamp\\nWe post pitches as Messages in Basecamp. We created a Message ', 'Category called Pitch so we can easily find them. Pitches are posted \\n\\nto a Team called Product Strategy that can be accessed by people on \\n\\nthe betting table.\\n\\nPitches on the Message Board of the Product Strategy team in Basecamp\\n\\nC H A P T E R   6   -   WR I T E  T H E   PI T C H\\n\\n6 7\\n\\n\\x0cA pitch as a Message. Note the one-week appetite.  \\n\\nThis was a Small Batch project.\\n\\nWhen we need to include a fat marker sketch in a pitch, we’ll draw \\n\\nit on an iPad (with Notability) and take a screenshot. Basecamp’s \\n\\ntext editor makes it easy to insert images and caption them so they \\n\\nmake sense in the flow of the pitch.\\n\\nA sketch drawn on an iPad in the middle of a pitch\\n\\n6 8\\n\\n\\x0cPeople comment on the pitch asynchronously. Not to say yes or no \\n\\n— that happens at the betting table — but to poke holes or contrib-\\n\\nute missing information.\\n\\nOur CTO responds with technical thoughts on the pitch.\\n\\nIn the next chapter we’ll look at the betting process in more detail \\n\\nto see where pitches go and how we turn them into  \\n\\nscheduled projects.\\n\\nC H A P T E R   6   -   WR I T E  T H E   PI T C H', '6 9\\n\\n\\x0c\\x0cP A R T   T W O\\n\\nBetting\\n\\n\\x0cBets, Not Backlogs\\n\\nNow that we’ve written a pitch, where does it go? It doesn’t go onto  \\n\\na backlog.\\n\\nNo backlogs\\nBacklogs are a big weight we don’t need to carry. Dozens and \\n\\neventually hundreds of tasks pile up that we all know we’ll never \\n\\nhave time for. The growing pile gives us a feeling like we’re always \\n\\nbehind even though we’re not. Just because somebody thought \\n\\nsome idea was important a quarter ago doesn’t mean we need to \\n\\nkeep looking at it again and again.\\n\\nBacklogs are big time wasters too. The time spent constantly \\n\\nreviewing, grooming and organizing old ideas prevents everyone \\n\\nfrom moving forward on the timely projects that really matter  \\n\\nright now.\\n\\n7 2\\n\\n\\x0cA few potential bets\\nSo what do we do instead? Before each six-week cycle, we hold \\n\\na betting table where stakeholders decide what to do in the next \\n\\ncycle. At the betting table, they look at pitches from the last six \\n\\nweeks — or any pitches that somebody purposefully revived and \\n\\nlobbied for again.\\n\\nNothing else is on the table. There’s no giant list of ideas to review. ', 'There’s no time spent grooming a backlog of old ideas. There are \\n\\njust a few well-shaped, risk-reduced options to review. The pitches \\n\\nare potential bets.\\n\\nWith just a few options and a six-week long cycle, these meetings \\n\\nare infrequent, short, and intensely productive.\\n\\nIf we decide to bet on a pitch, it goes into the next cycle to build. If \\n\\nwe don’t, we let it go. There’s nothing we need to track or hold on to.\\n\\nWhat if the pitch was great, but the time just wasn’t right? Anyone \\n\\nwho wants to advocate for it again simply tracks it independently—\\n\\ntheir own way—and then lobbies for it six weeks later.\\n\\nDecentralized lists\\nWe don’t have to choose between a burdensome backlog and not re-\\n\\nmembering anything from the past. Everyone can still track pitches, \\n\\nbugs, requests, or things they want to do independently without a \\n\\ncentral backlog.\\n\\nSupport can keep a list of requests or issues that come up more \\n\\noften than others. Product tracks ideas they hope to be able to \\n\\nshape in a future cycle. Programmers maintain a list of bugs they’d \\n\\nlike to fix when they have some time. There’s no one backlog or \\n\\nC H A P T E R   7   -   BE T S ,   NO T   B A C K L O G S', '7 3\\n\\n\\x0ccentral list and none of these lists are direct inputs to the  \\n\\nbetting process.\\n\\nRegular but infrequent one-on-ones between departments help \\n\\nto cross-pollinate ideas for what to do next. For example, Support \\n\\ncan tell Product about top issues they are seeing, which Product \\n\\ncan then track independently as potential projects to shape. Maybe \\n\\nProduct picks off just one of those top issues to work on now. Then, \\n\\nin a future one-on-one, Support can lobby again for something that \\n\\nhasn’t yet gotten attention.\\n\\nThis approach spreads out the responsibility for prioritizing and \\n\\ntracking what to do and makes it manageable. People from different \\n\\ndepartments can advocate for whatever they think is important and \\n\\nuse whatever method works for them to track those things—or not.\\n\\nThis way the conversation is always fresh. Anything brought back \\n\\nis brought back with a context, by a person, with a purpose. Every-\\n\\nthing is relevant, timely, and of the moment.\\n\\nImportant ideas come back\\nIt’s easy to overvalue ideas. The truth is, ideas are cheap. They \\n\\ncome up all the time and accumulate into big piles.\\n\\nReally important ideas will come back to you. When’s the last time \\n\\nyou forgot a really great, inspiring idea? And if it’s not that inter-', 'esting—maybe a bug that customers are running into from time to \\n\\ntime—it’ll come back to your attention when a customer complains \\n\\nagain or a new customer hits it. If you hear it once and never again, \\n\\nmaybe it wasn’t really a problem. And if you keep hearing about it, \\n\\nyou’ll be motivated to shape a solution and pitch betting time on it \\n\\nin the next cycle.\\n\\n7 4\\n\\n\\x0cThe Betting Table\\n\\nNow that we have some good potential bets in the form of pitches, \\n\\nit’s time to make decisions about which projects to schedule.\\n\\nSix-week cycles\\nCommitting time and people is difficult if we can’t easily determine \\n\\nwho’s available and for how long. When people are available at \\n\\ndifferent times due to overlapping projects, project planning turns \\n\\ninto a frustrating game of Calendar Tetris. Working in cycles dras-\\n\\ntically simplifies this problem. A cycle gives us a standard project \\n\\nsize both for shaping and scheduling.\\n\\nSome companies use two-week cycles (aka “sprints”). We learned \\n\\nthat two weeks is too short to get anything meaningful done. Worse \\n\\nthan that, two-week cycles are extremely costly due to the plan-\\n\\nning overhead. The amount of work you get out of two weeks isn’t ', 'worth the collective hours around the table to “sprint plan” or the \\n\\nC H A P T E R   8   -   TH E   BE T T I N G   T A B L E\\n\\n7 5\\n\\n\\x0copportunity cost of breaking everyone’s momentum to re-group.\\n\\nThis led us to try longer cycles. We wanted a cycle that would be \\n\\nlong enough to finish a whole project, start to end. At the same time, \\n\\ncycles need to be short enough to see the end from the beginning. \\n\\nPeople need to feel the deadline looming in order to make trade-\\n\\noffs. If the deadline is too distant and abstract at the start, teams \\n\\nwill naturally wander and use time inefficiently until the deadline \\n\\nstarts to get closer and feel real.\\n\\nAfter years of experimentation we arrived at six weeks. Six weeks is \\n\\nlong enough to finish something meaningful and still short enough \\n\\nto see the end from the beginning.\\n\\nCool-down\\nIf we were to run six-week cycles back to back, there wouldn’t be \\n\\nany time to breathe and think about what’s next. The end of a cycle \\n\\nis the worst time to meet and plan because everybody is too busy \\n\\nfinishing projects and making last-minute decisions in order to ship ', 'on time.\\n\\nTherefore, after each six-week cycle, we schedule two weeks for \\n\\ncool-down. This is a period with no scheduled work where we can \\n\\nbreathe, meet as needed, and consider what to do next.\\n\\nDuring cool-down, programmers and designers on project teams \\n\\nare free to work on whatever they want. After working hard to ship \\n\\ntheir six-week projects, they enjoy having time that’s under their \\n\\ncontrol. They use it to fix bugs, explore new ideas, or try out new  \\n\\ntechnical possibilities.\\n\\n7 6\\n\\n\\x0cTeam and project sizes\\nIn addition to standardizing the length of our cycles, we also \\n\\nroughly standardize the types of projects and teams that we bet on.\\n\\nOur project teams consist of either one designer and two program-\\n\\nmers or one designer and one programmer. They’re joined by a QA \\n\\nperson who does integration testing later in the cycle.\\n\\nThese teams will either spend the entire cycle working on one \\n\\nproject, or they’ll work on multiple smaller projects during the \\n\\ncycle. We call the team that spends the cycle doing one project the \\n\\nbig batch team and the team working on a set of smaller projects \\n\\nthe small batch team. Small batch projects usually run one or two \\n\\nweeks each. Small batch projects aren’t scheduled individually. It’s ', 'up to the small batch team to figure out how to juggle the work so \\n\\nthey all ship before the end of the cycle.\\n\\nNow that we have a standard way to think about capacity, we can \\n\\ntalk about how we decide what to schedule.\\n\\nThe betting table\\nThe betting table is a meeting held during cool-down where stake-\\n\\nholders decide what to do in the next cycle. The potential bets to \\n\\nconsider are either new pitches shaped during the last six weeks, or \\n\\npossibly one or two older pitches that someone specifically chose to \\n\\nrevive. As we said last chapter, there’s no “grooming” or backlog to \\n\\norganize. Just a few good options to consider.\\n\\nOur betting table at Basecamp consists of the CEO (who in our \\n\\ncase is the last word on product), CTO, a senior programmer, and a \\n\\nproduct strategist (myself).\\n\\nC H A P T E R   8   -   TH E   BE T T I N G   T A B L E\\n\\n7 7\\n\\n\\x0cC-level time is only available in small slices, so there’s an atmo-\\n\\nsphere of “waste no time” and the call rarely goes longer than an \\n\\nhour or two. Everyone has had a chance to study the pitches on ', 'their own time beforehand. Ad-hoc one-on-one conversations in \\n\\nthe weeks before usually establish some context too. Once the call \\n\\nstarts, it’s all about looking at the options that made it to the table \\n\\nand making decisions.\\n\\nThe output of the call is a cycle plan. Between everyone present, \\n\\nthere’s knowledge of who’s available, what the business priorities \\n\\nare, and what kind of work we’ve been doing lately. All of this feeds \\n\\ninto the decision-making process about what to do and who to \\n\\nschedule (more on this below).\\n\\nThe highest people in the company are there. There’s no “step two” \\n\\nto validate the plan or get approval. And nobody else can jump in \\n\\nafterward to interfere or interrupt the scheduled work.\\n\\nThis buy-in from the very top is essential to making the cycles \\n\\nturn properly. The meeting is short, the options well-shaped, \\n\\nand the headcount low. When these criteria are met, the betting \\n\\ntable becomes a place to exercise control over the direction of the \\n\\nproduct instead of a battle for resources or a plea for prioritization. \\n\\nWith cycles long enough to make meaningful progress and shaped \\n\\nwork that will realistically ship, the betting table gives the C-suite a \\n\\n“hands on the wheel” feeling they haven’t had since the early days.', 'The meaning of a bet\\nWe talk about “betting” instead of planning because it sets  \\n\\ndifferent expectations.\\n\\nFirst, bets have a payout. We’re not just filling a time box with tasks \\n\\n7 8\\n\\n\\x0cuntil it’s full. We’re not throwing two weeks toward a feature and \\n\\nhoping for incremental progress. We intentionally shape work into \\n\\na six-week box so there’s something meaningful finished at the end. \\n\\nThe pitch defines a specific payout that makes the bet  \\n\\nworth making.\\n\\nSecond, bets are commitments. If we bet six weeks, then we commit \\n\\nto giving the team the entire six weeks to work exclusively on that \\n\\nthing with no interruptions. We’re not trying to optimize every hour \\n\\nof a programmer’s time. We’re looking at the bigger movement of \\n\\nprogress on the whole product after the six weeks.\\n\\nThird, a smart bet has a cap on the downside. If we bet six weeks \\n\\non something, the most we can lose is six weeks. We don’t allow \\n\\nourselves to get into a situation where we’re spending multiples of \\n\\nthe original estimate for something that isn’t worth that price.\\n\\nLet’s look at these last two points more closely.\\n\\nUninterrupted time\\nIt’s not really a bet if we say we’re dedicating six weeks but then ', 'allow a team to get pulled away to work on something else.\\n\\nWhen you make a bet, you honor it. We do not allow the team to \\n\\nbe interrupted or pulled away to do other things. If people inter-\\n\\nrupt the team with requests, that breaks our commitment. We’d no \\n\\nlonger be giving the team a whole six weeks to do work that was \\n\\nshaped for six weeks of time.\\n\\nWhen people ask for “just a few hours” or “just one day,” don’t \\n\\nbe fooled. Momentum and progress are second-order things, like \\n\\ngrowth or acceleration. You can’t describe them with one point. You \\n\\nneed an uninterrupted curve of points. When you pull someone \\n\\nC H A P T E R   8   -   TH E   BE T T I N G   T A B L E\\n\\n7 9\\n\\n\\x0caway for one day to fix a bug or help a different team, you don’t \\n\\njust lose a day. You lose the momentum they built up and the time \\n\\nit will take to gain it back. Losing the wrong hour can kill a day. \\n\\nLosing a day can kill a week.\\n\\nWhat if something comes up during that six weeks? We still don’t \\n\\ninterrupt the team and break the commitment. The maximum ', 'time we’d have to wait is six weeks before being able to act on the \\n\\nnew problem or idea. If the cycle passes and that thing is still the \\n\\nmost important thing to do, we can bet on it for that cycle. This is \\n\\nwhy it’s so important to only bet one cycle ahead. This keeps our \\n\\noptions open to respond to these new issues. And of course, if it’s a \\n\\nreal crisis, we can always hit the brakes. But true crises are  \\n\\nvery rare.\\n\\nThe circuit breaker\\nWe combine this uninterrupted time with a tough but extremely \\n\\npowerful policy. Teams have to ship the work within the amount of \\n\\ntime that we bet. If they don’t finish, by default the project doesn’t \\n\\nget an extension. We intentionally create a risk that the project—as \\n\\npitched—won’t happen. This sounds severe but it’s extremely \\n\\nhelpful for everyone involved.\\n\\nFirst, it eliminates the risk of runaway projects. We defined our \\n\\nappetite at the start when the project was shaped and pitched. If \\n\\nthe project was only worth six weeks, it would be foolish to spend \\n\\ntwo, three or ten times that. Very few projects are of the “at all \\n\\ncosts” type and absolutely must happen now. We think of this like a ', 'circuit breaker that ensures one project doesn’t overload the system. \\n\\nOne project that’s taking too long will never freeze us or get in the \\n\\nway of new projects that could be more important.\\n\\n8 0\\n\\n\\x0cSecond, if a project doesn’t finish in the six weeks, it means we did \\n\\nsomething wrong in the shaping. Instead of investing more time \\n\\nin a bad approach, the circuit breaker pushes us to reframe the \\n\\nproblem. We can use the shaping track on the next six weeks to \\n\\ncome up with a new or better solution that avoids whatever rabbit \\n\\nhole we fell into on the first try. Then we’ll review the new pitch \\n\\nat the betting table to see if it really changes our odds of success \\n\\nbefore dedicating another six weeks to it.\\n\\nFinally, the circuit breaker motivates teams to take more ownership \\n\\nover their projects. As we’ll see in the next chapter, teams are given \\n\\nfull responsibility for executing projects. That includes making \\n\\ntrade-offs about implementation details and choosing where to cut \\n\\nscope. You can’t ship without making hard decisions about where \\n\\nto stop, what to compromise, and what to leave out. A hard dead-\\n\\nline and the chance of not shipping motivates the team to regularly \\n\\nquestion how their design and implementation decisions are affect-', 'ing the scope.\\n\\nWhat about bugs?\\nIf the teams aren’t interrupted in the six week cycle, how do we \\n\\nhandle bugs that come up?\\n\\nFirst we should step back and question our assumptions about bugs.\\n\\nThere is nothing special about bugs that makes them automatically \\n\\nmore important than everything else. The mere fact that something \\n\\nis a bug does not give us an excuse to interrupt ourselves or other \\n\\npeople. All software has bugs. The question is: how severe are \\n\\nthey? If we’re in a real crisis—data is being lost, the app is grind-\\n\\ning to a halt, or a huge swath of customers are seeing the wrong \\n\\nthing—then we’ll drop everything to fix it. But crises are rare. The \\n\\nC H A P T E R   8   -   TH E   BE T T I N G   T A B L E\\n\\n8 1\\n\\n\\x0cvast majority of bugs can wait six weeks or longer, and many don’t \\n\\neven need to be fixed. If we tried to eliminate every bug, we’d never \\n\\nbe done. You can’t ship anything new if you have to fix the whole \\n\\nworld first.\\n\\nThat said, nobody likes bugs. We still want ways to deal with them. \\n\\nThree strategies have worked for us.', '1. Use cool-down. Ask any programmer if there are things \\n\\nthey wish they could go back and fix and they’ll have a \\n\\nlist to show you. The cool-down period between cycles \\n\\ngives them time to do exactly that. Six weeks is not long \\n\\nto wait for the majority of bugs, and two weeks every six \\n\\nweeks actually adds up to a lot of time for fixing them.\\n\\n2. Bring it to the betting table. If a bug is too big to fix during \\n\\ncool-down, it can compete for resources at the betting table. \\n\\nSuppose a back-end process is slowing the app down and a \\n\\nprogrammer wants to change it from a synchronous step to an \\n\\nasynchronous job. The programmer can make the case for fixing \\n\\nit and shape the solution in a pitch. Then instead of interrupting \\n\\nother work, the people at the betting table can make a deliber-\\n\\nate decision. Time should always be used strategically. There’s \\n\\na huge difference between delaying other work to fix a bug \\n\\nversus deciding up front that the bug is worth the time to fix.\\n\\n3. Schedule a bug smash. Once a year—usually around the holi-\\n\\ndays—we’ll dedicate a whole cycle to fixing bugs. We call it a “bug ', 'smash.” The holidays are a good time for this because it’s hard \\n\\nto get a normal project done when people are traveling or taking \\n\\ntime off. The team can self-organize to pick off the most important \\n\\nbugs and solve long-standing issues in the front-end or back-end.\\n\\n8 2\\n\\n\\x0cKeep the slate clean\\nThe key to managing capacity is giving ourselves a clean slate with \\n\\nevery cycle. That means only betting one cycle at a time and never \\n\\ncarrying scraps of old work over without first shaping and consider-\\n\\ning them as a new potential bet.\\n\\nIt is crucial to maximize our options in the future. We don’t know \\n\\nwhat will happen in the next six weeks. We don’t know what bril-\\n\\nliant idea will emerge or what urgent request might appear.\\n\\nEven if we have some kind of road map in our heads at the time \\n\\nscale above cycles, we keep it in our heads and in our side-channel \\n\\ndiscussions. Each six weeks we learn what’s working and what \\n\\nisn’t, what’s important and what’s not. There’s no downside to \\n\\nkeeping the option open and massive upside from being available \\n\\nto act on the unexpected.\\n\\nWhat about projects that just can’t be done in one cycle? In that ', 'case we still only bet six weeks at a time. Suppose we envision a \\n\\nfeature that takes two cycles to ship. We reduce our risk dramat-\\n\\nically by shaping a specific six week target, with something fully \\n\\nbuilt and working at the end of that six weeks. If that goes as \\n\\nexpected, we’ll feel good about betting the next six weeks the way \\n\\nwe envisioned in our heads. But if it doesn’t, we could define a very \\n\\ndifferent project. Or we could put the multi-cycle thing on pause \\n\\nand do something urgent that came up. The important thing is that \\n\\nwe always shape what the end looks like for that cycle and that we \\n\\nkeep our options open to change course.\\n\\nC H A P T E R   8   -   TH E   BE T T I N G   T A B L E\\n\\n8 3\\n\\n\\x0cPlace Your Bets\\n\\nLook where you are\\nDepending on whether we’re improving an existing product or \\n\\nbuilding a new product, we’re going to set different expectations \\n\\nabout what happens during the six-week cycle.\\n\\nThis invites us to reflect on where we are in the arc of our product’s \\n\\ndevelopment and bet accordingly.\\n\\nExisting products\\nWhen we add features to an existing product, we follow the stan-', 'dard Shape Up process: shape the work, bet on it, and give it to a \\n\\nteam to build. We expect the team to finish and ship some version \\n\\nof the shaped work by the end of the cycle.\\n\\nOn an existing product, all of the existing code and design that isn’t \\n\\ngoing to change defines a kind of empty space that the new feature \\n\\nwill fit into. Shaping and building is like crafting a piece of furni-\\n\\nture for a house that is already built.\\n\\nNew products\\nNew products are different. Whereas adding to an existing product \\n\\nis like buying a couch for a room with fixed dimensions, new \\n\\nproduct development is like figuring out where the walls and the \\n\\nfoundation should go so the building will stand.\\n\\nWe’ve noticed three phases of work when we build a new product \\n\\nfrom scratch. In each phase, the way that we shape and our expec-\\n\\ntations for how the team will work together during the cycle are \\n\\n8 4\\n\\n\\x0cdifferent. These phases unfold over the course of multiple cycles, \\n\\nbut we still only bet one cycle at a time.\\n\\nR&D mode\\nAt the very earliest stages of a new product, our idea is just a theory \\n\\nor a glimmer. We don’t know if the bundle of features we imagine ', 'will hold together in reality, and the technical decisions about how \\n\\nto model them in code are even less clear.\\n\\nThis means there is a lot of scrapwork. We might decide half-way \\n\\nto standing up a feature that it’s not what we want and try another \\n\\napproach instead.\\n\\nIn other words, we can’t reliably shape what we want in advance \\n\\nand say: “This is what we want. We expect to ship it after six \\n\\nweeks.” We have to learn what we want by building it.\\n\\nWe call this stage R&D mode and adjust for it in three ways.\\n\\n1. Instead of betting on a well-shaped pitch, we mainly bet the \\n\\ntime on spiking some key pieces of the new product idea. The \\n\\nshaping is much fuzzier because we expect to learn by building.\\n\\n2. Rather than delegating to a separate build team, our senior \\n\\npeople make up the team. David (CTO) takes the program-\\n\\nming role and works with Jason (CEO and designer) or a senior \\n\\ndesigner with Jason’s guidance. This is necessary for two \\n\\nreasons. First, you can’t delegate to other people when you \\n\\ndon’t know what you want yourself. Second, the architectural \\n\\ndecisions will determine what’s possible in the product’s ', 'future — they define the “holes” that future features fit into. At \\n\\nthis phase the team needs to hold the vision of the product \\n\\nand be able to judge the long-term effects of design decisions.\\n\\nC H A P T E R   9   -   PL A C E   Y O U R   BE T S\\n\\n8 5\\n\\n\\x0c3. Lastly, we don’t expect to ship anything at the end of an R&D \\n\\ncycle. The aim is to spike, not to ship. In the best case we’ll \\n\\nhave some UI and code committed to serve as the foundation \\n\\nfor subsequent work. The goal is to learn what works so we can \\n\\ncommit to some load-bearing structure: the main code and UI \\n\\ndecisions that will define the form of the product going forward.\\n\\nWe can’t ship anything to customers with just a single cycle of R&D \\n\\nwork. But we still don’t commit to more than one cycle at a time. \\n\\nWe may learn from the first cycle that we aren’t ready to tackle the \\n\\nproduct yet. Or we may discover that our intuition rang true and \\n\\nthe product is coming together. Depending on how it goes, we’ll \\n\\ndecide cycle-by-cycle whether to continue spending informal time \\n\\nin R&D mode.', 'Production mode\\nIf we continue to get warmer after some R&D cycles, we’ll eventu-\\n\\nally reach a point where the most important architectural decisions \\n\\nare settled. The product does those few essential things that define \\n\\nit, and the foundation is laid for the dozens of other things we’ll \\n\\nhave to do before we can ship to customers.\\n\\nWith this structure in place, the senior team can bring in other \\n\\npeople to contribute. This is the flip to production mode, where we \\n\\nwork in formal cycles with clear-cut shaping, betting, and building \\n\\nphases. Production mode is like working on an existing product: the \\n\\nprecedent set by the R&D work enables new contributors to identify \\n\\nwhere new functionality belongs and how it fits into the whole.\\n\\nIn production mode:\\n\\n1.  Shaping is deliberate again. The shaped work describes \\n\\n8 6\\n\\n\\x0cwhat we expect to see at the end of the cycle.\\n\\n2. The team that builds the projects is no longer limited to the \\n\\nsenior group. It becomes possible to bet multiple teams \\n\\nin parallel (if you have them) and cover more ground.\\n\\n3. Shipping is the goal, not spiking. But because the product \\n\\nisn’t publicly available to customers yet, we define ‘ship-', 'ping’ differently. Shipping means merging into the \\n\\nmain codebase and expecting not to touch it again.\\n\\nSince we aren’t shipping to customers at the end of each cycle, we \\n\\nmaintain the option to remove features from the final cut before \\n\\nlaunch. This means we can still be experimental. We can bet six \\n\\nweeks on a feature without knowing if we’ll want it in the final \\n\\nproduct. That’s not a problem as long as we set expectations to the \\n\\nbuild team: we can’t predict what we’ll want in the final cut, and \\n\\nwe’re willing to risk this cycle to take our best swing at the idea.\\n\\nCleanup mode\\nIn the final phase before launching the new product, we throw all \\n\\nstructure out the window. We call this cleanup mode. It’s a free-for-\\n\\nall. We’ve built enough new products to learn that there are always \\n\\nthings we forget, things we miss, details that aren’t right, and bugs \\n\\nthat creep in over the course of the R&D and production  \\n\\nmode cycles.\\n\\nThere’s something about putting your finger near the launch button \\n\\nthat makes your hair stand up. Everything suddenly gets “real.” \\n\\nThings we dismissed before pop out at us with new importance.\\n\\nThat’s why we reserve some capacity at the end for the unexpected. ', 'In cleanup mode:\\n\\nC H A P T E R   9   -   PL A C E   Y O U R   BE T S\\n\\n8 7\\n\\n\\x0c1. There’s no shaping. The cycle is closer in spirit to the “bug \\n\\nsmash” mentioned in the previous chapter. Leadership \\n\\nstands at the helm throughout the cycle, calling atten-\\n\\ntion to what’s important and cutting away distractions.\\n\\n2. There aren’t clear team boundaries. Every-\\n\\none jumps in to help however they can.\\n\\n3. Work is “shipped” (merged to the main codebase) \\n\\ncontinuously in as small bites as possible.\\n\\nDiscipline is still important. We have to check ourselves to make \\n\\nsure these are must-haves we’re working on, not just our cold feet \\n\\nbegging us to delay launch. Cleanup shouldn’t last longer than  \\n\\ntwo cycles.\\n\\nCleanup is also the phase where leadership makes those “final cut” \\n\\ndecisions. A smaller surface area on a V1 means fewer questions \\n\\nto answer, less to support, and less we’re committing to maintain \\n\\nindefinitely. Sometimes we need to see all the features working as \\n\\na whole to judge what we can live without and what might require \\n\\ndeeper consideration before shipping it to customers.', 'Examples\\n\\nThe Dot Grid Calendar\\n\\nWe built the Dot Grid Calendar (see Chapter 2) for Basecamp, an \\n\\nexisting product. We shaped the project, bet six weeks on it, a team \\n\\nbuilt it, and then we shipped it straight to customers.\\n\\nA new product: HEY\\n\\nIn 2020, after two years of development, we launched a new email \\n\\napp and service called HEY. HEY was in R&D mode for the first year \\n\\n8 8\\n\\n\\x0cof its development. A team of three, Jason (CEO), David (CTO), and \\n\\nJonas (senior designer) explored a wide variety of ideas before set-\\n\\ntling on the core. Nearly a year of production mode cycles followed, \\n\\nwhere all of Basecamp’s teams fleshed out HEY’s feature set. We \\n\\nended with two cycles of cleanup and significantly cut back the \\n\\nfeature set to launch in July 2020.\\n\\nTo be precise, there was some overlap between R&D and production \\n\\nmode after that first year. Basecamp was big enough as a company \\n\\nthat the senior team could shape and delegate production-mode \\n\\nprojects around parts of the app that were settled while continuing \\n\\nto explore new territory in R&D mode themselves.\\n\\nEvery bet on HEY was placed one at a time. The betting table didn’t ', 'know they would be working on HEY for two years during those \\n\\nfirst few R&D cycles. Gradually they gained confidence in the idea \\n\\nand grew a big-picture appetite for how many cycles they were \\n\\nwilling to spend on HEY. But they made no specific commitments \\n\\nabout what would go into those cycles. And flipping attention back \\n\\nto Basecamp, our existing product, was always on the table.\\n\\nAn experimental feature: Hill Charts\\n\\nA third example shows some grey area. When we built the Hill \\n\\nCharts feature in Basecamp (see Chapter 13), we had no idea if it \\n\\nwas going to work out or not. Basecamp was an existing product, \\n\\nand it felt too risky to bet on releasing this experimental feature \\n\\nto customers. So we framed the project more like a production \\n\\nmode bet on a new product. We shaped a first version that was \\n\\njust functional enough to use ourselves. We didn’t expect to ship \\n\\nit to customers without doing an additional cycle on it. This was a \\n\\nrisk: we bet one cycle, not two. If it didn’t work out, we’d scrap it. If \\n\\nsomething more important came up, we might not ever schedule \\n\\nC H A P T E R   9   -   PL A C E   Y O U R   BE T S', '8 9\\n\\n\\x0cthe second cycle. But we ended up feeling confident after the first \\n\\ncycle. We shaped a project to round it out, decided to bet another \\n\\ncycle, and then shipped it to customers.\\n\\nQuestions to ask\\nHere are some common questions you might hear when people at \\n\\nthe betting table are debating which bets to place.\\n\\nDoes the problem matter?\\n\\nJust like in pitch write-ups, we always take care to separate problem \\n\\nand solution. The solution doesn’t matter if the problem isn’t  \\n\\nworth solving.\\n\\nOf course, any problem that affects customers matters. But we have \\n\\nto make choices because there will always be more problems than \\n\\ntime to solve them. So we weigh problems against each other. Is this \\n\\nproblem more important than that problem right now?\\n\\nHow the people at the table judge problems depends on their per-\\n\\nspective, role, and knowledge. For example, a problem might impact \\n\\na small segment of customers but put a disproportionate burden on \\n\\nsupport. Depending on your exposure to support and which aspect \\n\\nof the business you’re focused on, you may weigh that differently.\\n\\nSometimes a solution that is too complicated or too sweeping may \\n\\ninvite questions about the problem. Do we really need to make so \\n\\nmany changes across the app? Have we understood the problem ', 'specifically enough? Maybe there’s a way to narrow it down so that \\n\\nwe get 80% of the benefit from 20% of the change.\\n\\nIs the appetite right?\\n\\nIt’s good when we have a solution shaped to a reasonable time \\n\\nframe, like two or six weeks. But we might still debate whether it’s \\n\\n9 0\\n\\n\\x0cworth the time. Suppose a stakeholder says they aren’t interested \\n\\nin spending six weeks on a given pitch. The negotiation could go a \\n\\ncouple directions from there:\\n\\n1. Maybe the problem wasn’t articulated well enough, and there’s \\n\\nknowledge that the shaper can add to the conversation right now \\n\\nto swing opinion. For example, “Yeah it doesn’t happen often, but \\n\\nwhen it does people are so vocal about it that it really tarnishes \\n\\nperception of us.” Or “Maybe it sounds trivial, but support has \\n\\nto go through 11 time-consuming steps to get to resolution.”\\n\\n2. Sometimes saying “no” to the time commitment is really saying \\n\\nno to something else. Maybe there’s something about the solu-\\n\\ntion or the technical implementation they don’t like. Asking “How \\n\\nwould you feel if we could do it in two weeks?” can uncover that \\n\\nit’s not so much about the time. The CTO might answer, “I don’t ', 'want to introduce another dependency into that area of the app.”\\n\\n3. The shaper might just let the idea go if interest is too low.\\n\\n4. The shaper might go back to the drawing table and either \\n\\nwork on a smaller version (for a shorter appetite) or do \\n\\nmore research if they believe the problem is compel-\\n\\nling but they weren’t armed well enough to present it.\\n\\nIs the solution attractive?\\n\\nThe problem may be important and the appetite fair, but there can \\n\\nbe differences about the solution.\\n\\nFor example, adding interface elements to the screen carries an \\n\\ninvisible cost: giving up the real estate. A button in the corner of the \\n\\nhome page might perfectly solve the problem. But that real estate is \\n\\nvaluable. If we give it up now, we won’t be able to use it in the future. \\n\\nC H A P T E R   9   -   PL A C E   Y O U R   BE T S\\n\\n9 1\\n\\n\\x0cAre we selling it too cheaply to solve this particular problem?\\n\\nIf someone offers an immediate design solution, like “how about \\n\\nwe move that button to an action menu instead,” we might discuss \\n\\nit. But generally we’ll avoid doing design work or discussing tech-', 'nical solutions for longer than a few moments at the betting table. \\n\\nIf we catch ourselves spending too much time in the weeds we’ll \\n\\nremind ourselves “okay, we’re not doing design here” and move \\n\\nback up to the high level.\\n\\nIs this the right time?\\n\\nThe kind of project we want to do next can depend on which proj-\\n\\nects we’ve done recently. Maybe it’s been too long since we’ve made \\n\\na splash of news with a new feature. Or perhaps we’ve been build-\\n\\ning too many new features and feel overdue to fix some long-stand-\\n\\ning customer requests. Or if the teams spent the last couple cycles \\n\\nin the same area of the app, their morale may dip if we plan yet \\n\\nanother project doing the same kind of work.\\n\\nThose are all reasons that we might pass on a project even though \\n\\nit’s perfectly well shaped and valuable. The project’s great; it’s just \\n\\nnot the right time.\\n\\nAre the right people available?\\n\\nAs part of the betting process we choose who specifically will play \\n\\nwhich role on each team. That is, we’ll pair a project with a specific \\n\\nsmall team of a designer and one or two programmers. We have a \\n\\n“Core Product” team of designers and programmers and we select ', 'from that pool when planning teams for each cycle. The team will \\n\\nwork with each other for the whole cycle and then the next cycle \\n\\ncan be a different combination of people.\\n\\nDifferent projects require different expertise. Maybe we need some \\n\\n9 2\\n\\n\\x0cmore front-end programming on this one. Or this other one is going \\n\\nto invite a lot of scope creep so we need someone who’s good with \\n\\nthe scope hammer.\\n\\nThe type of work each person has been doing is another factor. \\n\\nSomeone who’s done a long string of small batch projects might \\n\\nprefer to take on a big batch, or vice versa.\\n\\nAnd lastly there’s always a little Calendar Tetris with peoples’ \\n\\navailability. Vacations or sabbaticals affect which projects we can \\n\\nschedule in the coming cycle.\\n\\nWe’ve seen some other companies use a different model where \\n\\ninstead of assigning the projects to people, they let the team \\n\\nmembers choose which projects they want to work on. Culturally, \\n\\nwe are too meeting-averse for this extra step. But we’ve heard it can \\n\\nwork well for some teams because the project teams have a little \\n\\nmore buy-in.\\n\\nPost the kick-off message\\nAfter the bets are made, someone from the betting table will write a ', 'message that tells everyone which projects we’re betting on for the \\n\\nnext cycle and who will be working on them.\\n\\nJason announces the bets for the next cycle with a Basecamp message\\n\\nC H A P T E R   9   -   PL A C E   Y O U R   BE T S\\n\\n9 3\\n\\n\\x0c\\x0cP A R T   T H R E E\\n\\nBuilding\\n\\n\\x0cHand Over Responsibility\\n\\nWe’ve made our bets and now it’s time to start the next cycle. How \\n\\ndoes the team get started?\\n\\nAssign projects, not tasks\\nWe don’t start by assigning tasks to anyone. Nobody plays the role \\n\\nof the “taskmaster” or the “architect” who splits the project up into \\n\\npieces for other people to execute.\\n\\nSplitting the project into tasks up front is like putting the pitch \\n\\nthrough a paper shredder. Everybody just gets disconnected pieces. \\n\\nWe want the project to stay “whole” through the entire process so \\n\\nwe never lose sight of the bigger picture.\\n\\nInstead, we trust the team to take on the entire project and work \\n\\nwithin the boundaries of the pitch. The team is going to define their \\n\\nown tasks and their own approach to the work. They will have full \\n\\nautonomy and use their judgement to execute the pitch as best as ', '9 6\\n\\n\\x0cthey can.\\n\\nTeams love being given more freedom to implement an idea the \\n\\nway they think is best. Talented people don’t like being treated like \\n\\n“code monkeys” or ticket takers.\\n\\nProjects also turn out better when the team is given responsibility \\n\\nto look after the whole. Nobody can predict at the beginning of a \\n\\nproject what exactly will need to be done for all the pieces to come \\n\\ntogether properly. What works on paper almost never works exactly \\n\\nas designed in practice. The designers and programmers doing the \\n\\nreal work are in the best position to make changes and adjustments \\n\\nor spot missing pieces.\\n\\nWhen teams are assigned individual tasks, each person can execute \\n\\ntheir little piece without feeling responsible for judging how all the \\n\\npieces fit together. Planning up front makes you blind to the reality \\n\\nalong the way.\\n\\nRemember: we aren’t giving the teams absolute freedom to invent \\n\\na solution from scratch. We’ve done the shaping. We’ve set the \\n\\nboundaries. Now we are going to trust the team to fill in the outline \\n\\nfrom the pitch with real design decisions and implementation.\\n\\nThis is where our efforts to define the project at the right level of \\n\\nabstraction—without too much detail—will pay off. With their talent ', 'and knowledge of the particulars, the team is going to arrive at a \\n\\nbetter finished product than we could have by trying to determine \\n\\nthe final form in advance.\\n\\nDone means deployed\\nAt the end of the cycle, the team will deploy their work. In the case \\n\\nof a Small Batch team with a few small projects for the cycle, they’ll \\n\\nC H A P T E R   1 0   -   HA N D   O V E R   RE S P O N S I B I L I T Y\\n\\n9 7\\n\\n\\x0cdeploy each one as they see fit as long as it happens before the end \\n\\nof the cycle.\\n\\nThis constraint keeps us true to our bets and respects the circuit \\n\\nbreaker. The project needs to be done within the time we budgeted; \\n\\notherwise, our appetite and budget don’t mean anything.\\n\\nThat also means any testing and QA needs to happen within the \\n\\ncycle. The team will accommodate that by scoping off the most \\n\\nessential aspects of the project, finishing them early, and coordinat-\\n\\ning with QA. (More on that later.)\\n\\nFor most projects we aren’t strict about the timing of help documen-\\n\\ntation, marketing updates, or announcements to customers and \\n\\ndon’t expect those to happen within the cycle. Those are thin-tailed ', 'from a risk perspective (they never take 5x as long as we think they \\n\\nwill) and are mostly handled by other teams. We’ll often take care \\n\\nof those updates and publish an announcement about the new \\n\\nfeature during cool-down after the cycle.\\n\\nKick-off\\nWe start the project by creating a new Basecamp project and adding \\n\\nthe team to it. Then the first thing we’ll do is post the shaped \\n\\nconcept to the Message Board. We’ll either post the original pitch or \\n\\na distilled version of it.\\n\\n9 8\\n\\n\\x0cThe first thing on the Basecamp project is a message with the shaped concept\\n\\nSince our teams are remote, we use the chat room in the Basecamp \\n\\nproject to arrange a kick-off call.\\n\\nArranging a call with the team to walk through the shaped work\\n\\nC H A P T E R   1 0   -   HA N D   O V E R   RE S P O N S I B I L I T Y\\n\\n9 9\\n\\n\\x0cThe call gives the team a chance to ask any important questions \\n\\nthat aren’t clear from the write-up. Then, with a rough understand-\\n\\ning of the project, they’re ready to get started.\\n\\nGetting oriented\\nWork in the first few days doesn’t look like “work.” No one is ', 'checking off tasks. Nothing is getting deployed. There aren’t any \\n\\ndeliverables to look at. Often there isn’t even much communication \\n\\nbetween the team in the first few days. There can be an odd kind of  \\n\\nradio silence.\\n\\nWhy? Because each person has their head down trying to figure \\n\\nout how the existing system works and which starting point is best. \\n\\nEveryone is busy learning the lay of the land and getting oriented.\\n\\nThe team figuring out where to start\\n\\n1 0 0\\n\\n\\x0cIt’s important for managers to respect this phase. Teams can’t just \\n\\ndive into a code base and start building new functionality imme-\\n\\ndiately. They have to acquaint themselves with the relevant code, \\n\\nthink through the pitch, and go down some short dead ends to \\n\\nfind a starting point. Interfering or asking them for status too early \\n\\nhurts the project. It takes away time that the team needs to find the \\n\\nbest approach. The exploration needs to happen anyway. Asking \\n\\nfor visible progress will only push it underground. It’s better to \\n\\nempower the team to explictly say “I’m still figuring out how to \\n\\nstart” so they don’t have to hide or disguise this legitimate work.\\n\\nGenerally speaking, if the silence doesn’t start to break after three ', 'days, that’s a reasonable time to step in and see what’s going on.\\n\\nImagined vs discovered tasks\\nSince the team was given the project and not tasks, they need to \\n\\ncome up with the tasks themselves. Here we note an important \\n\\ndifference between tasks we think we need to do at the start of a \\n\\nproject and the tasks we discover we need to do in the course of \\n\\ndoing real work.\\n\\nThe team naturally starts off with some imagined tasks—the ones \\n\\nthey assume they’re going to have to do just by thinking about the \\n\\nproblem. Then, as they get their hands dirty, they discover all kinds \\n\\nof other things that we didn’t know in advance. These unexpected \\n\\ndetails make up the true bulk of the project and sometimes present \\n\\nthe hardest challenges.\\n\\nTeams discover tasks by doing real work. For example, the designer \\n\\nadds a new button on the desktop interface but then notices there’s \\n\\nno obvious place for it on the mobile webview version. They record \\n\\na new task: figure out how to reveal the button on mobile. Or the \\n\\nC H A P T E R   1 0   -   HA N D   O V E R   RE S P O N S I B I L I T Y', '1 0 1\\n\\n\\x0cfirst pass of the design has good visual hierarchy, but then the \\n\\ndesigner realizes there needs to be more explanatory copy in a \\n\\nplace that disrupts the layout. Two new tasks: Change the layout to \\n\\naccommodate explanatory copy; write the explanatory copy.\\n\\nOften a task will appear in the process of doing something unre-\\n\\nlated. Suppose a programmer is working on a database migration. \\n\\nWhile looking at the model to understand the associations, she \\n\\nmight run into a method that needs to be updated for a different \\n\\npart of the project later. She’s going to want to note a task to update \\n\\nthat method later.\\n\\nThe way to really figure out what needs to be done is to start \\n\\ndoing real work. That doesn’t mean the teams start by building \\n\\njust anything. They need to pick something meaningful to build \\n\\nfirst. Something that is central to the project while still small \\n\\nenough to be done end-to-end—with working UI and working \\n\\ncode—in a few days.\\n\\nIn the next chapters we’ll look at how the team chooses that target \\n\\nand works together to get a fully integrated spike working.\\n\\n1 0 2\\n\\n\\x0cGet One Piece Done\\n\\nAs the team gets oriented, they start to discover and track the tasks ', 'they need to do to build the project. It’s important at this early \\n\\nphase that they don’t create a master plan of parts that should \\n\\ncome together in the 11th hour. If the team completes a lot of tasks \\n\\nbut there’s no “one thing” to click on and try out, it’s hard to feel \\n\\nprogress. A team can do a lot of work but feel insecure because they \\n\\ndon’t have anything real to show for it yet. Lots of things are done \\n\\nbut nothing is really done.\\n\\nInstead they should aim to make something tangible and demoable \\n\\nearly—in the first week or so. That requires integrating vertically \\n\\non one small piece of the project instead of chipping away at the \\n\\nhorizontal layers.\\n\\nIntegrate one slice\\nWe can think of projects in two layers: front-end and back-end, \\n\\nC H A P T E R   1 1   -   GE T   ON E   PI E C E   DO N E\\n\\n1 0 3\\n\\n\\x0cdesign and code. While technically speaking there are more layers \\n\\nthan this, these two are the primary integration challenge in  \\n\\nmost projects.\\n\\nSuppose the project starts with a lot of design. The team could \\n\\ndesign a variety of screens and even implement them as templates ', 'or views. But until they’re wired to a backend, nothing does any-\\n\\nthing. The work remains hypothetical and speculative.\\n\\nSame with the backend. A lot of tasks could be checked off, but \\n\\nwithout any UI—what can you do with it? How do you judge if the \\n\\nwork on a specific piece of business logic is really right without \\n\\ninteracting with it?\\n\\nWhat we want instead is to pick off one slice of the project to in-\\n\\ntegrate. Then when that’s done, the team has something tangible \\n\\nthat they’ve proven to work (or not work and reconsider). Anyone \\n\\ncan click through the interaction and see if the feature does what it \\n\\nshould and if what it does is what they want.\\n\\n1 0 4\\n\\n\\x0cCase study: Clients in projects\\nWe built a feature in Basecamp 3 that allowed service firms to invite \\n\\nclients to their projects and share chosen documents, messages, \\n\\nor to-do lists with them. The concept, defined in the pitch, had a \\n\\nvariety of moving parts:\\n\\n•  Client Access: Before this feature, Basecamp’s access \\n\\nmodel was all or nothing. We needed a way to invite \\n\\nsome people to see just some parts of a project. This \\n\\nhad major back-end and caching implications.', '•  Client Management: We needed a way to add clients to projects \\n\\nand the ability to manage clients separately from team members.\\n\\n•  Visibility Toggle: Each piece of content in a project \\n\\nshould have a toggle to expose it to clients or not.\\n\\nThe team had one designer and one programmer. After they got \\n\\noriented and familiar with how the existing code worked, the de-\\n\\nsigner chose the visibility toggle as the best place to integrate first. \\n\\nThis was the most central piece of UI in the project. It’s the one that \\n\\nwould appear in demo videos and the interaction customers would \\n\\nuse most.\\n\\nThe designer didn’t make a pixel-perfect mockup. Instead, he \\n\\nexperimented with different affordances and placements in the \\n\\napp’s HTML templates. Should the toggle be two radio buttons, a \\n\\nC H A P T E R   1 1   -   GE T   ON E   PI E C E   DO N E\\n\\n1 0 5\\n\\n\\x0ccheckbox, or a custom button that changes state?\\n\\nMeanwhile, the programmer wasn’t waiting around. He had enough \\n\\nguidance from the pitch to start spiking the access model.\\n\\nAs soon as the designer felt confident in the basic direction of the \\n\\nUI, he pinged the programmer and showed him the stubbed toggle. ', 'Stepping away from the access problem for a bit, the programmer \\n\\nwired the toggle enough so that it would appear on all the sup-\\n\\nported content types, change state when clicked, and save its state \\n\\nin the database.\\n\\nAt this point, the toggle didn’t actually change the visibility of the \\n\\ncontent. But it worked from the service firm’s point of view. The \\n\\ndesigner could click it, feel it, and judge how well it worked with \\n\\nlive data on a staging server.\\n\\nThere was still more design work to do on the toggle. But the pro-\\n\\ngrammer didn’t need to be involved anymore. With the affordance \\n\\nwired up, the designer could continue to experiment with copy, \\n\\nplacement, color, mobile view rendering, and more. Meanwhile, \\n\\nthe programmer could get back to the access model or whatever \\n\\nelse was most important to tackle next.\\n\\nAbout three days after the start of the project, the designer demoed \\n\\nthe working toggle to a manager. Their conversation led to a few \\n\\nmore tweaks and then they were able to call the toggle “done.” One \\n\\nimportant piece of the project was designed, implemented, demoed, \\n\\nand settled. The team felt good about showing tangible progress. \\n\\nAnd the team and management both felt confidence in the project ', 'by seeing a working piece. By clicking through a core interaction \\n\\nearly, they were able to validate that what they hoped would make \\n\\nsense in theory did indeed look right and make sense in practice.\\n\\n1 0 6\\n\\n\\x0cThis short example illustrates a few points about how the teams \\n\\nintegrate over short periods to finish one piece of the project at  \\n\\na time.\\n\\nProgrammers don’t need to wait\\nBecause the important moving parts were already defined in the \\n\\nshaping process, programmers don’t need to sit idle waiting for \\n\\ndesign when the project starts. There’s enough direction in the \\n\\npitch for them to start working on back-end problems from the start. \\n\\nThey won’t be able to take a piece of functionality to completion \\n\\nwithout knowing where it leads on the front-end, but there should \\n\\nbe enough information in the pitch to inform foundational  \\n\\nmodeling decisions.\\n\\nAffordances before pixel-perfect screens\\nProgrammers don’t need a pixel-perfect design to start implement-\\n\\ning. All they need are endpoints: input elements, buttons, places \\n\\nwhere stored data should appear. These affordances are the core of \\n\\na user interface design.\\n\\nQuestions about font, color, spacing, and layout can be resolved \\n\\nafter the raw affordances are in place and hooked up in code. Copy-', 'writing, basic affordances, and some wiring are all we need to try a \\n\\nlive working version in the browser or on the device. Then we can \\n\\nanswer the fundamental questions early: Does it make sense? Is it \\n\\nunderstandable? Does it do what we want?\\n\\nThat means the first interface a designer gives to a programmer can \\n\\nlook very basic, like the example below. It’s more like a breadboard \\n\\nthan a visual design or a polished mock-up.\\n\\nC H A P T E R   1 1   -   GE T   ON E   PI E C E   DO N E\\n\\n1 0 7\\n\\n\\x0cThis screenshot is from a registration app for multi-day courses. \\n\\nThe designer made it in HTML by hand. There’s barely any style \\n\\n— just enough visual hierarchy to feel confident that the layout is \\n\\nusable and amenable to future layers of styling.\\n\\nWhile the design looks simple, a lot of decisions are reflected in it.\\n\\n•  The decision to ask for arrival time but not depar-\\n\\nture time came from detailed discussions about \\n\\nthe business logic and pricing model.\\n\\n•  The specific options in the arrival time pulldown correspond \\n\\nto rules that had to be worked out about when to charge for ', 'meals and overnight stays.The designer’s first sketches used a \\n\\ncalendar-style date picker for the arrival and departure days. \\n\\nBut that led to UX problems. Some courses were long (multiple \\n\\nweeks) with different phases. There wasn’t room in a standard \\n\\ncalendar-style date picker to label the phases on the day boxes. \\n\\nWith a pulldown, she could use option groups to label groups of \\n\\ndates when needed. That way users wouldn’t need to reference a \\n\\nschedule elsewhere to be sure they were selecting the right dates.\\n\\n1 0 8\\n\\n\\x0cHere’s another example. This is the first working piece of an app for \\n\\ncapturing data from customer interviews.\\n\\nAt this early stage the project name (Basecamp) and interview \\n\\nsubject (Jan) were hard-coded and most of the links didn’t  \\n\\ngo anywhere.\\n\\nLook at how raw this design is. The actions are plain text links in \\n\\nthe default blue and purple browser colors. The boxes containing \\n\\nthe data points are barely styled with plain black borders. As rough \\n\\nas it is, this design tests some important trade-offs. The designer \\n\\nchose to show as much data as possible above the fold so it would \\n\\nbe easy to review interviews. That didn’t leave enough room within ', 'each section for UI to add, edit, or remove data points. That led the \\n\\ndesigner to create separate screens for adding and editing data  \\n\\nper section.\\n\\nC H A P T E R   1 1   -   GE T   ON E   PI E C E   DO N E\\n\\n1 0 9\\n\\n\\x0cThis is the first design for adding and editing “pulls” — a type \\n\\nof data in this interview technique. Again, look at how raw it is. \\n\\nThere’s just enough design here to quickly wire it up and test it. The \\n\\nteam can click through this to judge whether navigating to a sepa-\\n\\nrate screen to record data is acceptable or not. If it works, they can \\n\\nlayer on additional styling later. If it doesn’t work, they didn’t waste \\n\\na lot of time implementing a pixel-perfect design.\\n\\nBeautiful alignment, colors, and typography don’t matter on the \\n\\nfirst pass. Visual styling is important in the end product, not in the \\n\\nearly stages. The biggest uncertainties are about whether it will \\n\\nwork, whether it will make sense, and how hard it will be to im-\\n\\nplement. After the elements are wired up, they can be rearranged, \\n\\nrestyled, and repainted to improve the work that’s already done. ', 'First make it work, then make it beautiful.\\n\\nProgram just enough for the next step\\nThe same is true for back-end work. It doesn’t have to be all or \\n\\nnothing. Sometimes a designer just needs some scaffolding—a \\n\\ncouple fields that save data or some code to navigate from one \\n\\nstubbed screen to another. Other times she needs to populate a \\n\\nvariable in the template with a collection of real data so she can \\n\\niterate on different displays (rows, columns, media boxes, etc) to \\n\\nfind the best design.\\n\\nThe early back-end work can be strategically patchy. There might \\n\\nbe a controller to render templates but no model. Or a controller \\n\\nand bits of a model with mock data but no support for creating or \\n\\nupdating the data. Screens that aren’t wired yet could at least be \\n\\nconnected with routes for navigating between them.\\n\\nWhen it was time to test the first piece of the interview app, the \\n\\n1 1 0\\n\\n\\x0cteam knew there would be sensitive data from real interviews going \\n\\ninto it. They needed to protect it with some kind of authentication. \\n\\nRather than building full username and password support—or even \\n\\nintegrating a third-party solution—they just used plain HTTPAuth \\n\\nto hard-code a password.', 'This allowed the team to try adding data from real interviews very \\n\\nearly in the cycle, without slowing down to hook up some authen-\\n\\ntication code that wasn’t going to teach them anything about the \\n\\nproblems they were trying to solve.\\n\\nThe point is to create a back-and-forth between design and pro-\\n\\ngramming on the same piece of the product. Instead of one big \\n\\nhand-off, take turns layering in affordances, code, and visual \\n\\nstyling. Step by step, click through the real working feature-in-prog-\\n\\nress to judge how it’s coming and what to do next.\\n\\nStart in the middle\\nIn the examples above, the team didn’t build log in first. They didn’t \\n\\nbuild a way to create an interview project and an interview subject \\n\\nbefore solving the problem of adding interview data. They jumped \\n\\nstraight into the middle where the interesting problem was and \\n\\nstubbed everything else to get there.\\n\\nC H A P T E R   1 1   -   GE T   ON E   PI E C E   DO N E\\n\\n1 1 1\\n\\n\\x0cTo expand on this, here are three criteria to think about when \\n\\nchoosing what to build first:\\n\\nFirst, it should be core. The visibility toggle was core to the Clients ', 'in Projects concept. Without it, the other work wouldn’t mean \\n\\nanything. Contrast that with a more peripheral aspect of the project, \\n\\nlike the ability to rename a client. Both were “required,” but one \\n\\nwas more central and important to prove out early in the cycle. In \\n\\nthe interview app, recording interview data was more core—more in \\n\\nthe middle—than setting up a new research project.\\n\\nSecond, it should be small. If the first piece of work isn’t small \\n\\nenough, there isn’t much benefit to carving it off from the rest. The \\n\\npoint is to finish something meaningful in a few days and build mo-\\n\\nmentum—to have something real to click on that shows the team is \\n\\non the right track.\\n\\nThird, it should be novel. If two parts of the project are both core \\n\\nand small, prefer the thing that you’ve never done before. In the \\n\\nClients in Projects feature, the UI for adding clients was mostly the \\n\\nsame as the UI for adding regular users. Starting on that would \\n\\nhave moved the project forward, but it wouldn’t have taught the \\n\\nteam anything. It wouldn’t have eliminated uncertainty. Starting \\n\\nwith the visibility toggle boosted everyone’s confidence because it \\n\\nproved that a new idea was going to work.', '1 1 2\\n\\n\\x0cMap The Scopes\\n\\nIn the previous chapter, we started the project by finishing one \\n\\nintegrated slice early on. That practice belongs to a more general \\n\\ntechnique that the team can use throughout the project.\\n\\nOrganize by structure, not by person\\nWhen asked to organize tasks for a project, people often separate \\n\\nwork by person or role: they’ll create a list for Designers and a list \\n\\nfor Programmers. This leads to the problem we talked about in the \\n\\nprevious chapter—people will complete tasks, but the tasks won’t \\n\\nadd up to a finished part of the project early enough.\\n\\nTo take an example outside of software, consider someone orga-\\n\\nnizing a fundraising event. They could create a list of tasks for \\n\\neach of their three volunteers and track the work that way. But \\n\\nthen there’d be no way to see the big picture of how the event is \\n\\ncoming together—what’s done and what’s not done at the macro \\n\\nC H A P T E R   1 2   -   MA P   TH E   SC O P E S\\n\\n1 1 3\\n\\n\\x0clevel. Instead, they should create lists based on the structure of \\n\\nthe project—the things that can be worked on and finished inde-', 'pendently of each other. To do that, they would create lists for Food \\n\\nMenu, Venue Setup, and Light/Sound. Then the organizer can \\n\\neasily see which areas are done and which areas have  \\n\\noutstanding work.\\n\\nIn product development, the categories aren’t pre-cut for us. We \\n\\nusually build things we’ve never built before. Each project is a wild \\n\\nterritory that we have to walk through before we can draw a map. \\n\\nBy digging into the work, we figure out where the interdependen-\\n\\ncies are, how things are connected, and what we can slice apart.\\n\\nAs we saw in the previous chapter, the slices of work integrate front-\\n\\nend and back-end tasks. This allows us to finish one slice of the \\n\\nactual project and definitively move on. That’s better than having \\n\\nlots of pieces that—fingers crossed—are supposed to come together \\n\\nby the end of the cycle.\\n\\nWe call these integrated slices of the project scopes. We break the \\n\\noverall scope (singular) of the project into separate scopes (plural) \\n\\nthat can be finished independently of each other. In this chapter, \\n\\nwe’ll see how the team maps the project into scopes and tackles \\n\\nthem one by one.\\n\\nThe scope map\\nImagine an overhead view of ', 'the project. At the beginning, \\n\\nthere’s just an outline from \\n\\nthe shaping work that pre-\\n\\nceded the project. There aren’t \\n\\nany tasks or scopes yet.\\n\\n1 1 4\\n\\n\\x0cWhen the team members take over the project, they start discover-\\n\\ning tasks. Tasks are a natural starting point because they’re con-\\n\\ncrete and granular. It’s too early to organize them into higher level \\n\\ncategories. It would be artificial to try and group them arbitrarily. \\n\\nIt’s enough at the start just to capture a variety of things that need \\n\\nto happen.\\n\\nBut we don’t want to stay with this picture for long. It’s too low-\\n\\nlevel. There’s nothing visible from high altitude.\\n\\nAs the team starts doing real work on the project they learn how the \\n\\ntasks are related and what the structure of the project is really like. \\n\\nThen they become able to factor the project into scopes. This is like \\n\\ndividing the map of the project into separate territories.\\n\\nC H A P T E R   1 2   -   MA P   TH E   SC O P E S\\n\\n1 1 5\\n\\n\\x0cThe scopes reflect the meaningful parts of the problem that can be \\n\\ncompleted independently and in a short period of time—a few days ', 'or less. They are bigger than tasks but much smaller than the  \\n\\noverall project.\\n\\nThe map is a mental image. In practice, we define and track the \\n\\nscopes as to-do lists. Each scope corresponds to a list name. Then \\n\\nany tasks for that scope go in that list.\\n\\n1 1 6\\n\\n\\x0cThe language of the project\\nScopes are more than just slices. They become the language of the \\n\\nproject at the macro level. When we were building the Clients in \\n\\nProjects feature, the team used the language of the scopes like this: \\n\\n“After Bucket Access is done we can implement Invite Clients. Then \\n\\nwe’ll Update Recording Visibility when people on the firm flip the \\n\\nVisibility Toggle.”\\n\\nWhen it’s time to report status, the team uses the language of \\n\\nscopes to explain what’s done and what’s not done. It’s more \\n\\nsatisfying to have the conversation at a high level and point to fin-\\n\\nished pieces of software, instead of going down into the weeds and \\n\\ndefending the purposes and status of individual outstanding tasks. \\n\\n(We’ll see more in the next chapter about how to report on scopes \\n\\nusing the Hill Chart.)\\n\\nCase study: Message drafts\\nA designer and programmer were building a feature to create and ', 'save drafts of messages in a new app. After kick-off, they identified \\n\\na bunch of tasks they would need to do at some point.\\n\\nC H A P T E R   1 2   -   MA P   TH E   SC O P E S\\n\\n1 1 7\\n\\n\\x0cAs the end of the first week approached, they had completed some \\n\\nof the tasks, but there wasn’t anything to show for their work. In \\n\\nthe spirit of “get one piece done” they focused on one key interac-\\n\\ntion they could integrate: creating a new draft.\\n\\nThey called the new scope “Start New,” created a to-do list for it, \\n\\nand moved to-dos into it. There was only one design task left for \\n\\nthem to consider this scope finished.\\n\\nAfter finishing the one design task, the scope was complete.\\n\\n1 1 8\\n\\n\\x0cThe unscoped tasks that are left don’t represent all the work \\n\\nthat remains. More tasks are going to be discovered as they start \\n\\nworking on each of those. Still, there is enough variety in the work \\n\\nto tease out more scopes. The team was motivated to break out the \\n\\nscopes already at this point because they knew they wanted their \\n\\nefforts to add up to another visible piece being finished before long.', 'Taking a look at the tasks that were left, they decided to pull out \\n\\ntasks related to finding the drafts into a new scope called Locate \\n\\nand the task for deleting into a scope called Trash. The work that \\n\\nwas left all seemed related to saving and editing the draft, so they \\n\\ncalled that Save/Edit.\\n\\nTake a look at the Locate scope. There’s only one task there right \\n\\nnow. But surely there will be more work to do than just designing \\n\\nthe index. When there are implementation tasks to do, that’s where \\n\\nthey’ll go.\\n\\nThe designer started some work on Locate while the programmer \\n\\nfocused on Save/Edit. As she dug into it, she noticed she could \\n\\ncarve off a couple pieces to make more visible progress. There were \\n\\nreally three scopes in it.\\n\\nC H A P T E R   1 2   -   MA P   TH E   SC O P E S\\n\\n1 1 9\\n\\n\\x0cFirst she factored out the work related to sending the drafted \\n\\nmessage. She called that Send.\\n\\nFinally, some of the remaining Save/Edit tasks were about storing \\n\\ninformation and one other was actually unrelated—it was a special \\n\\ncase for handling drafts when replying to another message. She \\n\\nbroke these out into two new scopes: Store and Reply.', '1 2 0\\n\\n\\x0cAt this point the team suddenly felt like they could see the whole \\n\\nof the project at a high level. All the major parts were visible at the \\n\\nmacro level as scopes. None of them were so big that important or \\n\\nchallenging tasks could hide inside of them unnoticed.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the designer had made progress on Locate. After a little \\n\\nwiring, they were able to mark that done. Tasks were getting done \\n\\non Send and Store as well.\\n\\nOnce Send and Store were finished, just a couple tasks remained for \\n\\nTrash and Reply.\\n\\nC H A P T E R   1 2   -   MA P   TH E   SC O P E S\\n\\n1 2 1\\n\\n\\x0cAnd then the project was done.\\n\\nDiscovering scopes\\nScope mapping isn’t planning. You need to walk the territory before \\n\\nyou can draw the map. Scopes properly drawn are not arbitrary \\n\\ngroupings or categories for the sake of tidiness. They reflect the real \\n\\nground truth of what can be done independently—the underlying \\n\\ninterdependencies and relationships in the problem.\\n\\nScopes arise from interdependencies. The way parts depend on \\n\\neach other determines when you can say a given piece of the work \\n\\nis “done.” You don’t know what the work and interdependencies ', 'actually are in advance. We talked earlier about imagined versus \\n\\ndiscovered tasks. The same principle applies to scopes. The scopes \\n\\nneed to be discovered by doing the real work and seeing how things \\n\\nconnect and don’t connect.\\n\\nThat’s why at the start of a project, we don’t expect to see accurate \\n\\nscopes. We’re more likely to see them at the end of week one or start \\n\\nof week two, after the team has had a chance to do some real work \\n\\nand find the natural dividing lines in the anatomy of the problem.\\n\\nIt’s also normal to see some shuffling and instability in the scopes \\n\\nat first. The lines get redrawn or scopes renamed as the team feels \\n\\nout where the boundaries really are, like in the example above. The \\n\\n1 2 2\\n\\n\\x0cteam was focused on specific problems of saving and editing drafts, \\n\\nso it was easiest to identify that scope early. It wasn’t until they got \\n\\ninto the weeds that they noticed there were tasks specifically about \\n\\nsending the draft and made that a separate scope.\\n\\nHow to know if the scopes are right\\nWell-made scopes show the anatomy of the project. When you \\n\\nfeel a pain in your body, you don’t have to question whether it’s in ', 'your arms or your legs or your head. You know the parts and their \\n\\nnames so you can explain where the pain is. In the same way, every \\n\\nproject has a natural anatomy that arises from the design you want, \\n\\nthe system you’re working within, and the interdependencies of the \\n\\nproblems you have to solve.\\n\\nThree signs indicate when the scopes are right:\\n\\n1. You feel like you can see the whole project and nothing im-\\n\\nportant that worries you is hidden down in the details.\\n\\n2. Conversations about the project become more flowing \\n\\nbecause the scopes give you the right language.\\n\\n3. When new tasks come up, you know where to put them. The \\n\\nscopes act like buckets that you can easily lob new tasks into.\\n\\nOn the other hand, these three signs indicate the scopes should  \\n\\nbe redrawn:\\n\\n1. It’s hard to say how “done” a scope is. This often happens \\n\\nwhen the tasks inside the scope are unrelated. If the problems \\n\\ninside the scope are unrelated, finishing one doesn’t get you \\n\\ncloser to finishing the other. It’s good in this case to look for \\n\\nsomething you can factor out, like in the Drafts example.\\n\\nC H A P T E R   1 2   -   MA P   TH E   SC O P E S', '1 2 3\\n\\n\\x0c2. The name isn’t unique to the project, like “front-end” or \\n\\n“bugs.” We call these “grab bags” and “junk drawers.” This \\n\\nsuggests you aren’t integrating enough, so you’ll never get to \\n\\nmark a scope “done” independent of the rest. For example, \\n\\nwith bugs, it’s better to file them under a specific scope so \\n\\nyou can know whether, for example, “Send” is done or if you \\n\\nneed to fix a couple bugs first before putting it out of mind.\\n\\n3. It’s too big to finish soon. If a scope gets too big, with too \\n\\nmany tasks, it becomes like its own project with all the faults \\n\\nof a long master to-do list. Better to break it up into pieces \\n\\nthat can be solved in less time, so there are victories along \\n\\nthe way and boundaries between the problems to solve.\\n\\nLet’s close this chapter with a few tips for dealing with different \\n\\nkinds of tasks and scopes that will come up.\\n\\nLayer cakes\\nMost software projects require some UI design and a thin layer of \\n\\ncode below. Think of a database app where all you need to do is \\n\\nenter information, save it, and display it back. Work like this looks ', 'like a layer cake: You can judge the work by UI surface area because \\n\\nthe back-end work is thin and evenly distributed. In these cases, \\n\\nyou can integrate all design and programmer tasks together in the \\n\\nsame scope. This is a good default for most “information system” \\n\\ntype apps.\\n\\n1 2 4\\n\\n\\x0cIcebergs\\nBut sometimes there is significantly more back-end work than UI \\n\\nwork or vice versa. For example, a new feature that only requires \\n\\nsubmitting a form could require very complex business logic to \\n\\nreturn the right answer. This kind of work is like an iceberg.\\n\\nFor icebergs, it can help to factor out the UI as a separate scope of \\n\\nwork (assuming the UI isn’t interdependent with the back-end com-\\n\\nplexity). If the back-end is complex enough, you can split it into \\n\\nseparate concerns and then turn those into scopes as well. The goal \\n\\nin cases like this is to define some different things you can finish \\n\\nand integrate in stages, rather than waiting until the 11th hour with \\n\\nfingers crossed that it will all come together.\\n\\nYou also sometimes see upside-down icebergs, where there is a ton \\n\\nof UI complexity with less back-end complexity. For example, the ', 'data model for a calendar isn’t complicated, but the interaction \\n\\nfor rendering a multiple-day event and wrapping across grid cells \\n\\ncould take a lot of time and problem-solving.\\n\\nC H A P T E R   1 2   -   MA P   TH E   SC O P E S\\n\\n1 2 5\\n\\n\\x0cFor both back-end and front-end icebergs, we always question them \\n\\nbefore accepting them as a fact. Is the complexity really necessary \\n\\nand irreducible? Do we need that fancy UI? Is there a different way \\n\\nto build that back-end process so it has fewer interdependencies \\n\\nwith the rest of the system?\\n\\nChowder\\nThere are almost always a couple things that don’t fit into a scope. \\n\\nWe allow ourselves a “Chowder” list for loose tasks that don’t fit \\n\\nanywhere. But we always keep a skeptical eye on it. If it gets longer \\n\\nthan three to five items, something is fishy and there’s probably a \\n\\nscope to be drawn somewhere.\\n\\nMark nice-to-haves with ~\\nNew tasks constantly come up as you get deeper into a problem. \\n\\nYou’ll find code that could be cleaned up, edge cases to address, \\n\\nand improvements to existing functionality. A good way to deal ', 'with all those improvements is to record them as tasks on the scope \\n\\nbut mark them with a ~ in front. This allows everyone on the team \\n\\nto constantly sort out the must-haves from the nice-to-haves.\\n\\nIn a world with no deadlines, we could improve everything forever. \\n\\nBut in a fixed time box, we need a machete in our hands to cut \\n\\ndown the constantly growing scope. The ~ at the start of an item, or \\n\\neven a whole scope, is our best tool for that. We’ll come back to this \\n\\ntechnique when we talk about making cuts to scope in Chapter 14, \\n\\nDecide When to Stop.\\n\\n1 2 6\\n\\n\\x0cShow Progress\\n\\nGood-hearted managers don’t like asking for status. It’s awkward, \\n\\nfeels like nagging, and gets even worse when they have to ask fol-\\n\\nlow-up questions to get sufficiently clear about what’s going on.\\n\\nManagers would rather be able to see the status themselves when-\\n\\never they need to. We saw in the last chapter how organizing to-dos \\n\\ninto scopes helps the team to stay on top of the work. But this \\n\\ndoesn’t help the manager directly. There are a couple problems \\n\\nwith to-dos that make them insufficient for judging status.', 'The tasks that aren’t there\\nConsider a list with a few completed items and no incomplete items \\n\\nleft. This could mean that all the work is done. But it could also \\n\\nmean that the team knows there’s more work but hasn’t defined \\n\\ntasks yet.\\n\\nSometimes a team will define a scope early in the project without \\n\\npopulating it with tasks. It marks that some work needs to be done \\n\\nbut that actual tasks haven’t been discovered yet.\\n\\nC H A P T E R   1 3   -   SH O W   PR O G R E S S\\n\\n1 2 7\\n\\n\\x0cOr think about doing some QA at the end of a scope. All the tasks \\n\\nare done. There’s nothing else to do. Then the act of testing popu-\\n\\nlates the scope with new tasks for the issues found.\\n\\nThis goes back to the notion of imagined versus discovered tasks. In \\n\\nour naive notion of a list that’s planned up-front, somebody popu-\\n\\nlates it with items that are gradually checked off. In real life, issues \\n\\nare discovered by getting involved in the problem. That means \\n\\nto-do lists actually grow as the team makes progress.\\n\\nIf we tried to judge at t2 how far along the project is, we’d be misled. ', 'From an outsider’s perspective, there’s no way to know whether \\n\\nthe number of outstanding tasks will go down or up. To know \\n\\nthat, you’d need more context on the work inside the scope to \\n\\nunderstand what it means that those particular tasks are done and \\n\\nwhether others might still be coming.\\n\\n1 2 8\\n\\n\\x0cEstimates don’t show uncertainty\\nSome teams try to attach estimates to their tasks or scopes to report \\n\\nstatus. The problem with estimates is they have a very different \\n\\nmeaning depending on the nature of the work being estimated.\\n\\nSay you have two tasks, both estimated to take four hours. If one \\n\\ntask is something the team has done ten times in the past, you can \\n\\nbe confident in the estimate. Suppose the other task is something \\n\\nthe team has never done before, or it has unclear interdependen-\\n\\ncies. It could take the four hours if all goes perfectly, but due to the \\n\\nunknowns in it, it could stretch out to two to three days. It’s not \\n\\nmeaningful to write “4 hours, or maybe 3 days” as the estimate.\\n\\nRecognizing this, we came up with a way to see the status of the \\n\\nproject without counting tasks and without numerical estimates. ', 'We do that by shifting the focus from what’s done or not done to \\n\\nwhat’s unknown and what’s solved. To enable this shift, we use the \\n\\nmetaphor of the hill.\\n\\nWork is like a hill\\nEvery piece of work has two phases. First there’s the uphill phase of \\n\\nfiguring out what our approach is and what we’re going to do. Then, \\n\\nonce we can see all the work involved, there’s the downhill phase  \\n\\nof execution.\\n\\nC H A P T E R   1 3   -   SH O W   PR O G R E S S\\n\\n1 2 9\\n\\n\\x0cLet’s use an everyday example to get the feeling of the hill.\\n\\nSuppose you’re planning to host a dinner party. You’ve set the date, \\n\\nbut it’s still a couple weeks ahead and you haven’t thought about \\n\\nwhat to cook yet. You have no idea what type of cuisine the meal \\n\\nwill be or what dish to make. That would place you at the start of \\n\\nthe hill on the bottom-left.\\n\\nNext you think about who’s attending and note that a couple \\n\\npeople are vegetarian. That eliminates some options (like grilling \\n\\nout) but still leaves a lot of options open. You consider both Italian ', 'and Indian. You think Indian might be more fun to cook, with more \\n\\ninteresting vegetarian options. So you decide to look for  \\n\\nIndian recipes.\\n\\nAt this point, the question “What percent complete is the project?” \\n\\ndoesn’t even make sense. And if someone asked you to estimate \\n\\nhow long the shopping and prep will take, you couldn’t answer that \\n\\neither because you haven’t chosen a dish yet. The answer would \\n\\nbe: “I’ve done some work to figure out what kind of cuisine, but I \\n\\nhaven’t narrowed it down to a specific dish yet.” We can represent \\n\\nthat by putting you halfway up the “figuring it out” side of the hill.\\n\\n1 3 0\\n\\n\\x0cNext you do some searching online and look through your recipe \\n\\nbooks. You want to find a recipe that will be interesting but doesn’t \\n\\nrequire ingredients that will be too hard to find. You settle on a \\n\\nrecipe and prepare a shopping list.\\n\\nNow you are in a very different position than before. The feeling \\n\\nchanges from “I’m still not sure what I’m doing” to “Now I know \\n\\nwhat to do.” You’re at the top of the hill.\\n\\nC H A P T E R   1 3   -   SH O W   PR O G R E S S', '1 3 1\\n\\n\\x0cFrom this vantage point, you can see all of the steps that are left. \\n\\nIt’s even fair to estimate how long all the work will take (“Let’s \\n\\nsee…an hour to grocery shop, 30 minutes of prep, cook for 45 \\n\\nminutes…”).\\n\\nThe day before the dinner party, you go to the grocery store and buy \\n\\nthe ingredients. This moves you downhill. You’re closer to finishing \\n\\nthe task.\\n\\nNext comes the work of prepping and cooking the meal.\\n\\n1 3 2\\n\\n\\x0cAfter the meal is over, there’s just a little work left: the clean-up.\\n\\nNote how the hill shows how the work feels at different stages. The \\n\\nuphill phase is full of uncertainty, unknowns, and problem solving. \\n\\nThe downhill phase is marked by certainty, confidence, seeing \\n\\neverything, and knowing what to do.\\n\\nScopes on the hill\\nWe can combine the hill with the concept of scopes from the last \\n\\nchapter. The scopes give us the language for the project (“Locate,” \\n\\n“Reply”) and the hill describes the status of each scope  \\n\\n(“uphill,” “downhill”).\\n\\nTo see the status of the scopes, we can plot each one as a different ', 'color on the hill.\\n\\nThis is a snapshot from a project to implement recurring events in \\n\\nBasecamp. Here “Future-applying edits” is a scope that is still being \\n\\nworked out, with significant unknowns to solve. The other two \\n\\nscopes have no meaningful unknowns left, and “Global recurring \\n\\nevents” is closer to finished.\\n\\nC H A P T E R   1 3   -   SH O W   PR O G R E S S\\n\\n1 3 3\\n\\n\\x0cStatus without asking\\nWe built a feature exclusive to Basecamp for creating hill charts and \\n\\nupdating them with a few clicks. The team members, who have the \\n\\nfull context of where the work stands, intuitively drag the scopes \\n\\ninto position, and save a new update that’s logged on the project \\n\\n(see How to Implement Shape Up in Basecamp).\\n\\n1 3 4\\n\\n\\x0cFor managers, the ability to compare past states is the killer feature. \\n\\nIt shows not only where the work stands but how the work  \\n\\nis moving.\\n\\nWith this second-order view, managers can judge what’s in motion \\n\\nand what’s stuck. They can see which problems the team chose to \\n\\nsolve and how much time they spent at each stage from unknown ', 'to known to done.\\n\\nC H A P T E R   1 3   -   SH O W   PR O G R E S S\\n\\n1 3 5\\n\\n\\x0cThis report becomes the manager’s first destination when they feel \\n\\nanxious about a project. Since it’s self-serve, there’s no need to \\n\\ninterrupt the team with the awkward status question. And in cases \\n\\nwhere something doesn’t look right, the manager can jump directly \\n\\ninto a conversation about the relevant piece of work. “Looks like \\n\\n‘Autosave’ has been uphill for a while. What’s the unknown that’s \\n\\nholding it back?” The manager can workshop this specific piece \\n\\nof the project without having to first untangle it from all the other \\n\\nthings that are moving along as expected.\\n\\nNobody says “I don’t know”\\nNobody wants to raise their hand to management and say “I don’t \\n\\nknow how to solve this problem.” This causes teams to hide uncer-\\n\\ntainty and accumulate risk. The moments when somebody is stuck \\n\\nor going in circles are where the biggest risks and opportunities lie. \\n\\nIf we catch those moments early, we can address them with help \\n\\nfrom someone senior or by reworking the concept. If we don’t catch ', 'them, the unsolved problems could linger so far into the cycle that \\n\\nthey endanger the project.\\n\\nThe hill chart allows everybody to see that somebody might be \\n\\nstuck without them actually saying it. A dot that doesn’t move is \\n\\neffectively a raised hand: “Something might be wrong here.”\\n\\n1 3 6\\n\\n\\x0cOnce it’s been spotted, the language of uphill/downhill facilitates \\n\\nthe conversation. It’s less about the person (Looks like you’re \\n\\nstuck!) and more about the work. The question is: What can we \\n\\nsolve to get that over the hill?\\n\\nPrompts to refactor the scopes\\nSometimes probing into a stuck scope reveals that it isn’t stuck at \\n\\nall. The problem is in how the lines of the scope were drawn.\\n\\nHere’s a case where the “Notify” scope was stuck on the hill for  \\n\\ntoo long.\\n\\nWhen we checked in with the team, it turned out the work was \\n\\nmoving along just fine. The problem was that “Notify” wasn’t a \\n\\nsingle thing. It had three different parts: designing an email, de-\\n\\nlivering the email in the back-end, and displaying the notification \\n\\nin an in-app menu. The team mostly finished the code for deliver-\\n\\ning the email. The design of the email was nearly figured out. But ', 'they hadn’t started on the in-app display. It wasn’t possible to say \\n\\nwhether “Notify” as a whole was over the hill or not because parts \\n\\nof it were and parts of it weren’t.\\n\\nC H A P T E R   1 3   -   SH O W   PR O G R E S S\\n\\n1 3 7\\n\\n\\x0cThe solution in a case like this is to break the scope apart into \\n\\nsmaller scopes that can move independently.\\n\\nNow the team can move each dot to accurately show where the  \\n\\nwork stands.\\n\\n1 3 8\\n\\n\\x0cThe benefit comes at the second order. With the scopes separated \\n\\nout, they can move independently over time. Now the team can \\n\\nshow more progress more frequently than before.\\n\\nBuild your way uphill\\nSome teams struggle with backsliding when they first try the hill \\n\\nchart. They consider a scope solved, move it the top of the hill, \\n\\nand later have to slide it back when they uncover an unexpected \\n\\nunknown.\\n\\nWhen this happens, it’s often because somebody did the uphill \\n\\nwork with their head instead of their hands. Coming up with an \\n\\napproach in your head is just the first step uphill. We often have a \\n\\ntheory of how we’ll solve something—“I’ll just use that API”—and ', 'then the reality turns out to be more complicated. It’s good to think \\n\\nof the first third uphill as “I’ve thought about this,” the second \\n\\nthird as “I’ve validated my approach,” and the final third to the top \\n\\nas “I’m far enough with what I’ve built that I don’t believe there are  \\n\\nother unknowns.”\\n\\nSolve in the right sequence\\nIn addition to seeing where the work stands, we can use the hill \\n\\nchart to sequence the work—which problems to solve in  \\n\\nwhich order.\\n\\nC H A P T E R   1 3   -   SH O W   PR O G R E S S\\n\\n1 3 9\\n\\n\\x0cSome scopes are riskier than others. Imagine two scopes: One in-\\n\\nvolves geocoding data—something the team has never done before. \\n\\nThe other is designing and implementing an email notification. \\n\\nBoth have unknowns. Both start at the bottom of the hill. This is \\n\\nwhere the team asks themselves: If we were out of time at the end \\n\\nof the cycle, which of these could we easily whip together—despite \\n\\nthe unknowns—and which might prove to be harder than we think?\\n\\nThat motivates the team to push the scariest work uphill first. Once ', 'they get uphill, they’ll leave it there and look for anything critically \\n\\nimportant before finishing the downhill work to completion. It’s \\n\\nbetter to get a few critical scopes over the top early in the project \\n\\nand leave the screw-tightening for later.\\n\\nWork expands to fill the time available. If the team starts with the \\n\\nemail template first, they could easily spend weeks iterating on \\n\\ncopy or creating the ultimate best-ever email design. But they don’t \\n\\nneed to do that. There’s some version of an email template that \\n\\ncould be worked out in a day during the final week and it would be \\n\\nsufficient. The geocoder, on the other hand, might present novel \\n\\nproblems that the team could struggle with for weeks. They don’t \\n\\nwant that surprise to come at the end of the cycle.\\n\\nJournalists have a concept called the “inverted pyramid.” The idea \\n\\nis their articles start with the most essential information at the top, \\n\\nthen they add details and background information in decreasing \\n\\norder of importance. This allows print newspaper designers to get \\n\\nthe crucial part of the story on the front page and cut the end as \\n\\nneeded without losing anything essential.\\n\\nEffective teams sequence their problem solving in the same way. \\n\\nThey choose the most important problems first with the most ', '1 4 0\\n\\n\\x0cunknowns, get them to the top of the hill, and leave the things that \\n\\nare the most routine or least worrisome for last.\\n\\nAs the end of the cycle approaches, teams should have finished the \\n\\nimportant things and left a variety of “nice to haves” and “maybes” \\n\\nlingering around. That brings us to the next chapter, on deciding \\n\\nwhen to stop.\\n\\nC H A P T E R   1 3   -   SH O W   PR O G R E S S\\n\\n1 4 1\\n\\n\\x0cDecide When to Stop\\n\\nWhen the end of the cycle approaches, the techniques we covered \\n\\nso far will put the team in a good position to finish and ship. The \\n\\nshaped work gave them guard rails to prevent them from wander-\\n\\ning. They integrated one scope at a time so there isn’t half-finished \\n\\nwork lying around. And all the most important problems have been \\n\\nsolved because they prioritized those unknowns first when they \\n\\nsequenced the work.\\n\\nStill, there’s always more work than time. Shipping on time means \\n\\nshipping something imperfect. There’s always some queasiness in \\n\\nthe stomach as you look at your work and ask yourself: Is it good ', 'enough? Is this ready to release?\\n\\n1 4 2\\n\\n\\x0cCompare to baseline\\nDesigners and programmers always want to do their best work. It \\n\\ndoesn’t matter if the button is on the center of the landing page or \\n\\ntwo pages down a settings screen, the designer will give it their best \\n\\nattention. And the best programmers want the code base to feel like \\n\\na cohesive whole, completely logically consistent with every edge \\n\\ncase covered.\\n\\nPride in the work is important for quality and morale, but we need \\n\\nto direct it at the right target. If we aim for an ideal perfect design, \\n\\nwe’ll never get there. At the same time, we don’t want to lower our \\n\\nstandards. How do we make the call to say what we have is good \\n\\nenough and move on?\\n\\nIt helps to shift the point of comparison. Instead of comparing up \\n\\nagainst the ideal, compare down to baseline—the current reality \\n\\nfor customers. How do customers solve this problem today, without \\n\\nthis feature? What’s the frustrating workaround that this feature \\n\\neliminates? How much longer should customers put up with some-\\n\\nthing that doesn’t work or wait for a solution because we aren’t sure \\n\\nif design A might be better than design B?', 'Seeing that our work so far is better than the current alternatives \\n\\nmakes us feel better about the progress we’ve made. This motivates \\n\\nus to make calls on the things that are slowing us down. It’s less \\n\\nabout us and more about value for the customer. It’s the difference \\n\\nbetween “never good enough” and “better than what they have \\n\\nnow.” We can say “Okay, this isn’t perfect, but it definitely works \\n\\nand customers will feel like this is a big improvement for them.”\\n\\nC H A P T E R   1 4   -   DE C I D E   WH E N  T O   S T O P\\n\\n1 4 3\\n\\n\\x0cMake scope cuts by comparing down to baseline  \\n\\ninstead of up to some perfect ideal\\n\\nLimits motivate trade-offs\\nRecall that the six-week bet has a circuit breaker—if the work \\n\\ndoesn’t get done, the project doesn’t happen.\\n\\nThis forces the team to make trade-offs. When somebody says \\n\\n“wouldn’t it be better if…” or finds another edge case, they should \\n\\nfirst ask themselves: Is there time for this? Without a deadline, \\n\\nthey could easily delay the project for changes that don’t actually \\n\\ndeserve the extra time.', 'We expect our teams to actively make trade-offs and question the \\n\\nscope instead of cramming and pushing to finish tasks. We create \\n\\nour own work for ourselves. We should question any new work that \\n\\ncomes up before we accept it as necessary.\\n\\nScope grows like grass\\nScope grows naturally. Scope creep isn’t the fault of bad clients, \\n\\nbad managers, or bad programmers. Projects are opaque at the \\n\\nmacro scale. You can’t see all the little micro-details of a project \\n\\nuntil you get down into the work. Then you discover not only \\n\\n1 4 4\\n\\n\\x0ccomplexities you didn’t anticipate, but all kinds of things that \\n\\ncould be fixed or made better than they are.\\n\\nEvery project is full of scope we don’t need. Every part of a product \\n\\ndoesn’t need to be equally prominent, equally fast, and equally \\n\\npolished. Every use case isn’t equally common, equally critical, or \\n\\nequally aligned with the market we’re trying to sell to.\\n\\nThis is how it is. Rather than trying to stop scope from growing, \\n\\ngive teams the tools, authority, and responsibility to constantly cut  \\n\\nit down.\\n\\nCutting scope isn’t lowering quality\\nPicking and choosing which things to execute and how far to ', 'execute on them doesn’t leave holes in the product. Making choices \\n\\nmakes the product better. It makes the product better at some \\n\\nthings instead of others. Being picky about scope differentiates the \\n\\nproduct. Differentiating what is core from what is peripheral moves \\n\\nus in competitive space, making us more alike or more different \\n\\nthan other products that made different choices.\\n\\nVariable scope is not about sacrificing quality. We are extremely \\n\\npicky about the quality of our code, our visual design, the copy in \\n\\nour interfaces, and the performance of our interactions. The trick is \\n\\nasking ourselves which things actually matter, which things move \\n\\nthe needle, and which things make a difference for the core use \\n\\ncases we’re trying to solve.\\n\\nScope hammering\\nPeople often talk about “cutting” scope. We use an even stronger \\n\\nword—hammering—to reflect the power and force it takes to repeat-\\n\\nedly bang the scope so it fits in the time box.\\n\\nC H A P T E R   1 4   -   DE C I D E   WH E N  T O   S T O P\\n\\n1 4 5\\n\\n\\x0cAs we come up with things to fix, add, improve, or redesign during \\n\\na project, we ask ourselves:', '•  Is this a “must-have” for the new feature?\\n\\n•  Could we ship without this?\\n\\n•  What happens if we don’t do this?\\n\\n•  Is this a new problem or a pre-existing one \\n\\nthat customers already live with?\\n\\n•  How likely is this case or condition to occur?\\n\\n•  When this case occurs, which customers see it? Is it \\n\\ncore—used by everyone—or more of an edge case?\\n\\n•  What’s the actual impact of this case or con-\\n\\ndition in the event it does happen?\\n\\n•  When something doesn’t work well for a particular use case, \\n\\nhow aligned is that use case with our intended audience?\\n\\nThe fixed deadline motivates us to ask these questions. Variable \\n\\nscope enables us to act on them. By chiseling and hammering the \\n\\nscope down, we stay focused on just the things we need to do to \\n\\nship something effective that we can be proud of at the end of the \\n\\ntime box.\\n\\nThroughout the cycle, you’ll hear our teams talking about must-\\n\\nhaves and nice-to-haves as they discover work. The must-haves are \\n\\ncaptured as tasks on the scope. The scope isn’t considered “done” \\n\\nuntil those tasks are finished. Nice-to-haves can linger on a scope ', 'after it’s considered done. They’re marked with a tilde (~) in front. \\n\\nThose tasks are things to do if the team has extra time at the end \\n\\n1 4 6\\n\\n\\x0cand things to cut if they don’t. Usually they never get built. The act \\n\\nof marking them as a nice-to-have is the scope hammering.\\n\\nA finished scope with one nice-to-have (marked with a “~”)  \\n\\nthat was never completed\\n\\nQA is for the edges\\nAt Basecamp’s current size (millions of users and about a dozen \\n\\npeople on the product team), we have one QA person. They come in \\n\\ntoward the end of the cycle and hunt for edge cases outside the  \\n\\ncore functionality.\\n\\nQA can limit their attention to edge cases because the designers \\n\\nand programmers take responsibility for the basic quality of their \\n\\nwork. Programmers write their own tests, and the team works to-\\n\\ngether to ensure the project does what it should according to what \\n\\nwas shaped. This follows from giving the team responsibility for \\n\\nthe whole project instead of assigning them individual tasks (see \\n\\nChapter 9, Hand Over Responsibility).\\n\\nFor years we didn’t have a QA role. Then after our user base grew \\n\\nto a certain size, we saw that small edge cases began to impact ', 'hundreds or thousands of users in absolute numbers. Adding the \\n\\nC H A P T E R   1 4   -   DE C I D E   WH E N  T O   S T O P\\n\\n1 4 7\\n\\n\\x0cextra QA step helped us improve the experience for those users and \\n\\nreduce the disproportional burden they would create for support.\\n\\nTherefore we think of QA as a level-up, not a gate or a check-point \\n\\nthat all work must go through. We’re much better off with QA than \\n\\nwithout it. But we don’t depend on QA to ship quality features that \\n\\nwork as they should.\\n\\nQA generates discovered tasks that are all nice-to-haves by default. \\n\\nThe designer-programmer team triages them and, depending on \\n\\nseverity and available time, elevates some of them to must-haves. \\n\\nThe most rigorous way to do this is to collect incoming QA issues on \\n\\na separate to-do list. Then, if the team decides an issue is a must-\\n\\nhave, they drag it to the list for the relevant scope it affects. This \\n\\nhelps the team see that the scope isn’t done until the issue  \\n\\nis addressed.\\n\\nWe treat code review the same way. The team can ship without ', 'waiting for a code review. There’s no formal check-point. But code \\n\\nreview makes things better, so if there’s time and it makes sense, \\n\\nsomeone senior may look at the code and give feedback. It’s more \\n\\nabout taking advantage of a teaching opportunity than creating a \\n\\nstep in our process that must happen every time.\\n\\nWhen to extend a project\\nIn very rare cases, we’ll extend a project that runs past its deadline \\n\\nby a couple weeks. How do we decide when to extend a project and \\n\\nwhen to let the circuit breaker do its thing?\\n\\nFirst, the outstanding tasks must be true must-haves that withstood \\n\\nevery attempt to scope hammer them.\\n\\nSecond, the outstanding work must be all downhill. No unsolved \\n\\n1 4 8\\n\\n\\x0cproblems; no open questions. Any uphill work at the end of the \\n\\ncycle points to an oversight in the shaping or a hole in the concept. \\n\\nUnknowns are too risky to bet on. If the work is uphill, it’s better \\n\\nto do something else in the next cycle and put the troubled project \\n\\nback in the shaping phase. If you find a viable way to patch the \\n\\nhole, then you can consider betting more time on it again in the \\n\\nfuture.\\n\\nEven if the conditions are met to consider extending the project, we ', 'still prefer to be disciplined and enforce the appetite for most proj-\\n\\nects. The two-week cool-down usually provides enough slack for a \\n\\nteam with a few too many must-haves to ship before the next cycle \\n\\nstarts. But this shouldn’t become a habit. Running into cool-down \\n\\neither points back to a problem in the shaping process or a perfor-\\n\\nmance problem with the team.\\n\\nC H A P T E R   1 4   -   DE C I D E   WH E N  T O   S T O P\\n\\n1 4 9\\n\\n\\x0cMove On\\n\\nLet the storm pass\\nShipping can actually generate new work if you’re not careful. \\n\\nFeature releases beget feature requests. Customers say “Okay, that’s \\n\\ngreat, but what about that other thing we’ve been asking for?” \\n\\nBugs pop up. Suggestions for improvements come in. Everyone is \\n\\nfocused on the new thing and reacting to it.\\n\\nThe feedback can be especially intense if the feature you shipped \\n\\nchanges existing workflows.

Add the people doing the shaping, any trusted people \\n\\nwho give feedback on pitches, and the people who \\n\\nbet at the betting table. Keep this group small and an-\\n\\nnounce the bets more widely elsewhere (we use Base-\\n\\ncamp’s HQ for that), when it’s time to kick off a cycle.\\n\\n3.

After the team gets oriented they start spiking, dis-\\n\\ncover tasks, and map them into scopes.\\n\\n2. In the Basecamp Project, the team creates a To-Do List for each \\n\\nscope, like “Start Autopay” or “ACH Option.” Sometimes we use ', 'the description field on the To-Do List to summarize the scope.\\n\\n3. Add design and programming tasks to each scope as To-Do \\n\\nItems. For example, “Start Autopay” has one task for design \\n\\nthe UI and another task for wiring it to the existing recur-\\n\\nring billing API.

This is shaping. Shaping the work sets \\n\\nclearer boundaries and expectations for whoever does the work—\\n\\nwhether that’s a separate team or just your future self. If we don’t \\n\\nmake trade-offs up front by shaping, the universe will force us to \\n\\nmake trade-offs later in a mad rush when we’re confronted by dead-\\n\\nlines, technical limitations, or resource constraints.\\n\\nThe same is true with betting. Six weeks might not be the exact \\n\\ntime frame for your team. But the consequences of making unclear \\n\\nor open-ended commitments are the same for everyone. Regardless \\n\\nof the specific time frame we bet on, we should be deliberate about ', 'what we bet on and cap our downside with a circuit breaker.\\n\\nIn the building phase, there will be unknowns to deal with whether \\n\\nyou track them on a hill chart or not. We need to distinguish the \\n\\nknowns from the unknowns so we can sequence the work in the \\n\\nright order and reserve capacity for the unknowns.\\n\\nThese truths apply regardless of the size of your organization. The \\n\\nspecific practices, on the other hand, are scale-dependent. Let’s \\n\\nhave a look at what it means to implement Shape Up at a very small \\n\\nstart-up and an organization that’s grown big enough for special-\\n\\nized roles and more structure.\\n\\nC H A P T E R   1 8   -   AD J U S T  T O   Y O U R   SIzE\\n\\n1 6 5\\n\\n\\x0cSmall enough to wing it\\nWhen your team is just two or three people, everybody does a bit of \\n\\neverything. Since a few people are wearing many hats and per-\\n\\nforming many roles, it’s difficult to commit long chunks of uninter-\\n\\nrupted time to specific projects. The person doing the programming \\n\\nmight also be answering customer requests and dealing with an \\n\\ninfrastructure issue all at the same time.\\n\\nIt’s also easier to communicate and change course when you’re ', 'small. You can drop something in the group chat or talk about it in \\n\\nperson and everyone’s immediately on the same page.\\n\\nFor these reasons, a tiny team can throw out most of the structure. \\n\\nYou don’t need to work six weeks at a time. You don’t need a cool-\\n\\ndown period, formal pitches or a betting table. Instead of parallel \\n\\ntracks with dedicated shapers and builders, the same people can \\n\\nalternate back and forth. Be deliberate about which hat you’re \\n\\nwearing and what phase you’re in. Set an appetite, shape what to \\n\\ndo next, build it, then shape the next thing. Your bets might be \\n\\ndifferent sizes each time: maybe two weeks here, three weeks there. \\n\\nYou’re still shaping, betting, and building, but you’re doing it more \\n\\nfluidly without the rigid structure of cycles and cool-downs.\\n\\nThe phases of the work still hold true even if you don’t work in cycles  \\n\\nor have dedicated people to do the shaping and building\\n\\n1 6 6\\n\\n\\x0cBig enough to specialize\\nAfter you hire more people, all of this fluidity flips from an asset to \\n\\na liability. Winging it with ad-hoc meetings and chat room discus-\\n\\nsions doesn’t work anymore. Coordination starts to eat up more of ', 'your time and things begin to slip through the cracks.\\n\\nThis is when it makes sense to take on the structure of six-week \\n\\ncycles, cool-downs, and a formal betting table. With more people \\n\\navailable to build, someone needs to carve out more time to do \\n\\nthe work of figuring out what to build. This could mean a founder \\n\\nspends more time shaping than building, or it could mean elevat-\\n\\ning an employee from doing in-cycle design work to more out-of-cy-\\n\\ncle shaping work.\\n\\nAt Basecamp’s current size (about 50 people in the whole company, \\n\\nroughly a dozen in the product team) we’ve been able to specialize \\n\\nroles so teams of designers and programmers can work without any \\n\\ninterruption in the cycles. A dedicated team called SIP (Security, In-\\n\\nfrastructure, and Performance) handles technical work that’s lower \\n\\nin the stack and more structural. Our Ops team keeps the lights on. \\n\\nWe have technical people on the Support team who can investigate \\n\\nproblems raised by customers. All this means that we don’t need to \\n\\ninterrupt the designers and programmers on our Core Product team \\n\\nwho work on shaped projects within the cycles.\\n\\nC H A P T E R   1 8   -   AD J U S T  T O   Y O U R   SIzE', '1 6 7\\n\\n\\x0cWith dedicated shapers and builders, the picture is more structured. \\n\\nShapers work on an “out of cycle” track. Cool-down between cycles \\n\\ngives everyone room to fix bugs and address loose ends that pop up. \\n\\nThe betting table is held during cool-down and then bets are placed \\n\\nfor the next cycle.\\n\\nWith more people, shaping and building happen on separate tracks  \\n\\nand bets are made to fill six-week cycles\\n\\n1 6 8\\n\\n\\x0cHow to Begin to Shape Up\\n\\nOption A: One six-week experiment\\nYou don’t need to change everything all at once. If the whole \\n\\nproduct team isn’t ready to make a big change, just start off with a \\n\\nsingle six-week experiment. These are the steps to take:\\n\\n1. Shape one significant project that can be com-\\n\\nfortably finished within six weeks. Be conserva-\\n\\ntive and allow extra time on your first run.\\n\\n2. Carve out one designer and two programmers’ time \\n\\nfor the entire six weeks. Guarantee that nobody will in-\\n\\nterrupt them for the length of the experiment.\\n\\n3. Instead of a proper betting table, simply plan for the team \\n\\nto do the work you shaped for this one experiment.\\n\\n4. Kick off by presenting your shaped work to the team, with all ', 'the ingredients of a pitch. Set the expectation that they will \\n\\ndiscover and track their own tasks. (Hand Over Responsibility)\\n\\n5. Dedicate a physical space or a chat room to the cross-func-\\n\\ntional team so they can work closely together.\\n\\n6. Encourage them to Get One Piece Done by wiring \\n\\nUI and code together early in the project.\\n\\nYou don’t need to worry about Mapping the Scopes or Showing \\n\\nProgress right away. You should see a big leap in progress just by \\n\\ndedicating uninterrupted time, shaping the work in advance, and \\n\\nletting the team work out the details.\\n\\nC H A P T E R   1 9   -   HO W  T O   BE G I N  T O   SH A P E   UP\\n\\n1 6 9\\n\\n\\x0cOnce the team gets used to Getting One Piece Done, the stage will \\n\\nbe set for properly mapping scopes down the road. It’s the same \\n\\nidea, just repeated. Later still, when they are good at defining \\n\\nscopes, you can use the hill chart to Show Progress on those scopes.\\n\\nThis approach lets you demonstrate success with one team and a \\n\\nsingle six-week commitment. With credibility gained from a good \\n\\noutcome, it’ll be easier to lobby for a bigger change and convert the ', 'wider team to working this way.\\n\\nOption B: Start with shaping\\nSometimes it’s not possible to get a team together to work for six \\n\\nweeks because somebody else, a CTO perhaps, controls the pro-\\n\\ngrammers’ time. In that case, you can start by shaping a compelling \\n\\nproject with clearer boundaries than past projects. Present the \\n\\nproject and put it through your company’s existing scheduling \\n\\nprocess (even if it’s a paper shredder). Better-shaped work can \\n\\nshine a light on the engineering team and help them open up to \\n\\nthings like longer cycles or a more deliberate betting process.\\n\\nOption C: Start with cycles\\nAnother approach is to start by working in six week cycles. For \\n\\nteams that formerly used two-week sprints, this removes the over-\\n\\nhead of constant planning meetings and gives programmers more \\n\\ntime to build momentum and hit their stride. Once the team has \\n\\nmore room to breathe, it’ll be natural to think more about how to \\n\\nshape the work to take advantage of this new capacity.\\n\\n1 7 0\\n\\n\\x0cFix shipping first\\nBuild your shipping muscles before you worry too much about im-\\n\\nproving your research or discovery process. You can have the best \\n\\ncustomer insight in the world, but if you can’t turn it into a project ', 'and ship, it won’t matter. First get the team into a rhythm of finish-\\n\\ning things. Once you have the capability to ship, then you can start \\n\\nimproving the inputs to your shaping process.\\n\\nFocus on the end result\\nSometimes it can be scary to give the teams more free rein to set \\n\\ntheir own tasks and schedule. You might wonder: What if they \\n\\ndon’t use up all the time we dedicate for the cycle? What if one of \\n\\nthe programmers or designers sits idle at some point in the cycle?\\n\\nTo overcome these worries, shift the mindset from the micro to the \\n\\nmacro. Ask yourself: How will we feel if we ship this project after \\n\\nsix weeks? Will we feel good about what we accomplished? When \\n\\nprojects ship on time and everyone feels they made progress, that’s \\n\\nthe success. It doesn’t matter what exactly happened down at the \\n\\nscale of hours or days along the way. It’s the outcome that matters.\\n\\nC H A P T E R   1 9   -   HO W  T O   BE G I N  T O   SH A P E   UP\\n\\n1 7 1\\n\\n\\x0cGlossary\\n\\nAppetite\\n\\nThe amount of time we want to spend on a project, as opposed to  ', 'an estimate.\\n\\nBaseline\\n\\nWhat customers are doing without the thing we’re  \\n\\ncurrently building.\\n\\nBet\\n\\nThe decision to commit a team to a project for one cycle with no \\n\\ninterruptions and an expectation to finish.\\n\\nBetting table\\n\\nA meeting during cool-down when stakeholders decide which \\n\\npitches to bet on in the next cycle.\\n\\nBig batch\\n\\nOne project that occupies a team for a whole cycle and ships at  \\n\\nthe end.\\n\\nBreadboard\\n\\nA UI concept that defines affordances and their connections \\n\\nwithout visual styling.\\n\\nCircuit breaker\\n\\nA risk management technique: Cancel projects that don’t ship in \\n\\none cycle by default instead of extending them by default.\\n\\nCleanup mode\\n\\nThe last phase of building a new product, where we don’t shape \\n\\nor bet on any particular projects but instead allocate unstructured \\n\\ntime to fix whatever is needed before launch.\\n\\n1 7 2\\n\\n\\x0cCool-down\\n\\nA two-week break between cycles to do ad-hoc tasks, fix bugs, and \\n\\nhold a betting table.\\n\\nCycle\\n\\nA six week period of time where teams work uninterruptedly on \\n\\nshaped projects.\\n\\nDe-risk\\n\\nImprove the odds of shipping within one cycle by shaping and \\n\\nremoving rabbit holes.\\n\\nDiscovered tasks\\n\\nTasks the team discovers they need to do after they start getting ', 'involved in the real work.\\n\\nDownhill\\n\\nThe phase of a task, scope or project where all unknowns are solved \\n\\nand only execution is left.\\n\\nFat marker sketch\\n\\nA sketch of a UI concept at very low fidelity drawn with a thick line.\\n\\nHill chart\\n\\nA diagram showing the status of work on a spectrum from \\n\\nunknown to known to done.\\n\\nIceberg\\n\\nA scope of work where the back-end work is much more complex \\n\\nthan the UI or vice versa.\\n\\nImagined tasks\\n\\nWork the teams decide they need to do after just thinking about the \\n\\nproject.

It currently has 75 offices (and\\ncounting) around the world and employs some 4500 professionals.\\nIt may not be the largest strategy firm in the world—some of the\\nbig accounting firms have larger practices—but it is certainly the\\nmost prestigious. McKinsey consults to most of the Fortune 100,\\nas well as to many U.S. state and federal agencies and foreign \\ngovernments. McKinsey is a brand name in international business\\ncircles. \\n\\nSeveral senior McKinsey partners have risen to international\\nprominence in their own right. Lowell Bryan advised the Senate\\nBanking Committee during the savings and loan crisis. Kenichi\\nOhmae (who recently left the Firm) writes books on management\\n\\nCopyright 1999 Ethan M. Rasiel.

Herb Henzler advised\\nformer German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on business and eco-\\nnomic  matters.  Even  more  visible  are  some  of  McKinsey’s\\n“alumni,” who have gone on to senior positions around the world:', 'lence; Harvey Golub, president of American Express; and Adair\\nTurner, president of the Confederation of British Industries, to\\nname but three. \\n\\nTo maintain its preeminent position (and to earn its high fees)\\nthe Firm seeks out the cream of each year’s crop of business school\\ngraduates. It lures them with high salaries, the prospect of a rapid\\nrise through McKinsey’s meritocratic hierarchy, and the chance to\\nmingle with the elite of the business world. In return, the Firm\\ndemands total devotion to client service, submission to a grueling\\nschedule that can include weeks or months away from home and\\nfamily, and only the highest-quality work. For those who meet\\nMcKinsey’s standards, promotion can be rapid. Those who fall\\nshort soon find themselves at the latter end of the Firm’s strict pol-\\nicy of “up or out.”\\n\\nLike any strong organization, the Firm has a powerful corpo-\\nrate culture based on shared values and common experiences. Every\\nMcKinsey-ite goes through the same rigorous training programs\\nand suffers through the same long nights in the office. To outsiders,\\nthis can make the Firm seem monolithic and forbidding—one recent\\nbook on management consulting likened McKinsey to the Jesuits. ', 'human as its employees are.\\n\\nThe Firm has its own jargon too. It is full of acronyms: EM, ED,\\nDCS, ITP, ELT, BPR, and so forth. McKinsey-ites call their assign-\\nments or projects “engagements.” On an engagement, a McKinsey\\nteam will search for the “key drivers” in their quest to “add value.”\\nLike most jargon, much of this is simply verbal shorthand; some\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction\\n\\nxiii\\n\\nof  it,  however,  once  understood,  can  be  as  useful  to  business-\\npeople outside the Firm as it is to McKinsey-ites themselves.\\n\\nIn sum, like any powerful organization, McKinsey is complex. I\\nhope this book will lift at least a corner of the veil of the McKinsey\\nmystique and allow you, the reader, a peek into the inner workings\\nof a very successful company.\\n\\nABOUT THIS BOOK\\nI have divided this book into five parts. In the first three, I explain\\nhow McKinsey-ites think about business problems and how they\\nwork at solving them. Parts One through Three are the “meat” of\\nthe book, and I hope that you will find in them something new to', 'McKinsey-ites have learned for coping with the stresses of life at\\nthe  Firm.  Anyone  who  works  hard  in  today’s  business  world\\nshould learn something useful—or at least amusing—there. Finally,\\nPart Five briefly recounts some lessons learned at the Firm and\\nshares a few memories of McKinsey.\\n\\nI wrote this book with the goal of communicating new and use-\\nful skills to everyone who wants to be more efficient and effective\\nin  business.  Anyone  who  wants  to  learn  proven  methods  for\\napproaching business problems in a structured, fact-based way will\\nfind them in these pages. And anyone looking for survival tips in\\nthe jungle of today’s business world can benefit from doing things\\nthe McKinsey way.\\n\\nIn addition, this book will give any executive who works with\\nmanagement consultants, whether from McKinsey or elsewhere,\\nsome insight into how these strange beings think. Although each\\nconsulting firm has—or at least claims to have—its own methods,\\nthe root of all management consulting is the application of objec-\\n\\n\\x0cxiv\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\ntive analysis by dispassionate outsiders. Other firms may not do\\nthings the McKinsey way, but their consultants’ minds work in sim-', '\\nI based this book on my own experience as a McKinsey associ-\\nate from 1989 to 1992. I learned an enormous amount in that time,\\nbut scarcely enough for me to explain to the world the skills that\\nMcKinsey-ites use to succeed. Fortunately, I had help. I interviewed\\ndozens of former associates, engagement managers, and partners of\\nthe Firm. Their knowledge and the lessons they learned during their\\ntime at McKinsey helped fill the many gaps in my own knowledge.\\n\\nABOUT CLIENTS\\nThe word client appears in almost every chapter of this book. Since\\nI’m writing from the McKinsey perspective, I use client to mean the\\norganization for which you are solving a business problem. If you\\nare not a consultant of some form, then strictly speaking, when\\nyou are working on a business problem, you don’t have a client. I’d\\nlike to put it another way: You—or your organization—are your\\nown client. Seen that way, the term client becomes applicable to\\nany  organization  in  which  you  work,  whether  as  outsider  or\\ninsider. In addition, I believe that thinking about your own orga-\\nnization as your client does make it easier to take advantage of the', '\\n* * *\\n\\nOne of the cardinal virtues within McKinsey is confidentiality. The\\nFirm guards its secrets closely. I, along with every other former\\nMcKinsey-ite, agreed never to disclose confidential information\\nabout the Firm and its clients, even after leaving McKinsey. I do\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction\\n\\nXV\\n\\nnot intend to break that agreement. Consequently, most of the\\nnames of companies and people in this book have been disguised. \\nAs I said at the beginning, this book can be read from start to\\nfinish or dipped into like a box of chocolates. Whichever way you\\nchoose, I hope you’ll find something you like.\\n\\n\\x0cThis page intentionally left blank.\\n\\n\\x0cTHE\\nMCKINSEY \\nWAY\\n\\n\\x0cThis page intentionally left blank.\\n\\n\\x0c(cid:2)\\n\\nPART ONE\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nTHE \\nMCKINSEY WAY\\nOF THINKING\\nABOUT BUSINESS\\nPROBLEMS\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nCopyright 1999 Ethan M. Rasiel.  Click here for Terms of Use.\\n\\n\\x0c(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nMcKinsey exists to solve business problems. The con-\\n\\nsultants who succeed at McKinsey love to solve prob-\\n\\nlems. As one former EM* put it:', 'Problem solving isn’t a thing you do at McKin-\\n\\nsey; it’s what you do at McKinsey. It’s almost\\n\\nas though you approached everything looking\\n\\nfor ways it could be better, whatever it was. A\\n\\npart of you is always asking, “Why is some-\\n\\nthing done this way? Is this the best way it can\\n\\nbe done?” You have to be fundamentally skep-\\n\\ntical about everything.\\n\\nPart  One  describes  how McKinsey  thinks  about\\n\\nbusiness problems. It shows what it means to be fact-\\n\\nbased, structured, and hypothesis-driven. It will tell you\\n\\nthe McKinsey way to approach a business problem, and\\n\\noffer you a few choice rules to live by when trying to\\n\\nsolve them.\\n\\n*Engagement manager. The EM is in charge of the day-to-day work of a McKin-\\nsey team.\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n\\x0c1\\n\\nBUILDING THE SOLUTION\\n\\nLike all things McKinsey, the Firm’s problem-solving process\\nhas three major attributes. When team members meet for the\\nfirst time to discuss their client’s problem, they know that\\ntheir solution will be\\n\\n• Fact-based\\n• Rigidly structured\\n• Hypothesis-driven*\\n\\nIn this chapter, you will learn exactly what these attributes', '\\n*At McKinsey, three is a magic number. Things at the Firm come in threes. Notice that this\\nlist has three items. Ask a McKinsey-ite a complex question, and you are likely to hear\\n“There are three reasons. . .” Then, of course (as you will learn later in the book) there is the\\ntrue McKinsey hierarchy for consultants—in descending order: client, Firm, you.\\n\\nCopyright 1999 Ethan M. Rasiel.

Don’t fear the facts.\\n\\nProblem solving at the Firm begins with facts. On the first day of\\nan engagement, all members of the team comb through stacks of\\narticles and internal research documents to gather enough facts to\\nilluminate their piece of the problem for the first team meeting.\\nHaving drawn up an initial hypothesis for the problem, the team\\nthen races to gather the facts necessary (when put through the\\nappropriate analyses) to support or refute it.\\n\\nAt the start of your time at McKinsey, gathering and analyz-\\n\\ning facts is your raison d’étre. As one former SEM* observed:', 'When you strip away a lot of the high-minded language with\\nwhich McKinsey dresses up its problem-solving process, it\\ncomes down to very careful, high-quality analysis of the\\ncomponents of the problem combined with an aggressive\\nattitude toward fact gathering.\\n\\nWhy are facts so important to the way McKinsey does busi-\\nness? There are two reasons. First, facts compensate for lack of\\ngut instinct (see “ . . . But Every Client Is Unique” in Chapter 2).\\nMost McKinsey-ites are generalists. They know a little about a lot\\nof things. As they gain experience and move through the ranks,\\nthey may come to know a lot about a lot of things. Even at this\\npoint, however, they will still know less about, say, inventory\\n\\n*Senior engagement manager.

Gut instinct might tell those folks the\\nsolution  to  an  inventory  management  problem  in  10  seconds', 'will go to the facts first.\\n\\nSecond, facts bridge the credibility gap. When she joins the\\nFirm, the typical associate* (at least in the United States) will have\\ngraduated near the top of her college class, spent two or three years\\nworking for a large company, then received her MBA from a top\\nbusiness school. She will be in her mid- to late twenties. On her\\nfirst engagement she may have to present her analysis to the CEO\\nof a Fortune 50 company, who will not give much credence to\\nwhat some newly minted, 27-year-old MBA has to say—unless she\\nhas an overwhelming weight of facts to back her up. This is just\\nas true for a junior executive presenting a proposal to his boss.\\n\\nDespite (or possibly because of) the power of facts, many busi-\\nnesspeople fear them. Perhaps they are afraid that if they look too\\nclosely at the facts, they—or someone above them—might not like\\nwhat they see. Maybe they think that if they don’t look, the nasty\\nfacts will go away—but they won’t. Hiding from the facts is a pre-\\nscription for failure—eventually, truth will out. You must not fear', '\\n*Associate: An entry-level McKinsey consultant, usually with an MBA. Technically, every\\nconsultant who has not made partner, even the hottest SEM, is still an associate of the Firm.\\n\\n\\x0c6\\n\\nThinking About Business Problems\\n\\nFEEL FREE TO BE MECE\\nTo structure your thinking when solving business problems\\n(or anything, for that matter), you must be complete while\\navoiding confusion and overlap.\\n\\nMECE (pronounced “me-see”) stands for “mutually exclusive, col-\\nlectively exhaustive” and it is a sine qua non of the problem-solving\\nprocess at McKinsey. MECE gets pounded into every new associate’s\\nhead  from  the  moment  of  entering  the  Firm.  Every  document\\n(including internal memos), every presentation, every e-mail and\\nvoice mail produced by a McKinsey-ite is supposed to be MECE.\\nAsk any number of McKinsey alumni what they remember most\\nabout  the  way  the  Firm  solves  problems  and  they  will  tell  you,\\n“MECE, MECE, MECE.”\\n\\nMECE structures your thinking with maximum clarity (hence\\nminimum confusion) and maximum completeness. MECE starts at\\nthe top level of your solution—the list of issues making up the prob-', 'issues, take a hard look at them. Is each one a separate and distinct\\nissue? If so, then your issue list is mutually exclusive. Does every\\naspect  of  the  problem  come  under  one  (and  only  one)  of  these\\nissues—that is, have you thought of everything? If so, then your issues\\nare collectively exhaustive. Suppose your team is working on a study\\nfor that famous American manufacturing firm Acme Widgets. The\\nproblem you face is “We need to sell more widgets.” Your team might\\ncome up with a list of the following ways to increase widget sales:\\n\\n• Changing the way we sell our widgets to retail outlets.\\n• Improving the way we market our widgets to consumers. \\n• Reducing the unit cost of our widgets.\\n\\n\\x0cBuilding the Solution\\n\\n7\\n\\nIf this list looks rather generic, that’s fine; we will talk about\\nmoving down a level of detail in the next section. What matters is\\nthat the list is MECE.\\n\\nSuppose you add another item, say, “Reengineering our widget\\nproduction process.” How does that fit with the three issues you\\nalready have? This is certainly an important issue, but it isn’t a\\nfourth point alongside the others. It falls under “Reducing the unit', 'ution system” and “Improving our inventory management.” Why?\\nBecause  all  these  are  ways  to  reduce  the  unit  cost  of  widgets.\\nPutting any (or all) of them with the other three issues on the list\\nwould cause an overlap. The items in the list would no longer be\\nmutually exclusive. Overlap represents muddled thinking by the\\nwriter and leads to confusion for the reader.\\n\\nOnce you have a list in which all the items are separate and\\ndistinct (i.e., mutually exclusive), you have to check that it also\\nincludes every issue or item relevant to the problem (i.e., it is col-\\nlectively exhaustive). Go back for a moment to “Reengineering\\nour widget production process.” You put this under “Reducing\\nthe unit cost.” Now one of your team members says, “We should\\nthink about ways to improve widget quality through the produc-\\ntion process.” \\n\\nShe’s  right.  Does  this  mean  you  should  go  back  to  having\\nreengineering as an issue in its own right? No, but you should\\nrefine your list to include, under “Reducing unit cost,” the sub-\\nissue “Reengineering the production process to reduce unit cost,”', '“Reengineering the production process to improve widget quality.”\\nNow you have something that looks like this:\\n\\n• Changing the way we sell our widgets to retail outlets.\\n• Improving the way we market our widgets to consumers. \\n\\n\\x0c8\\n\\nThinking About Business Problems\\n\\n–Reengineering the production process to improve widget \\nquality.\\n\\n• Reducing the unit cost of our widgets.\\n\\n–Reengineering the production process to reduce unit cost.\\n\\nSuppose your team has come up with some interesting ideas\\nthat don’t fit under the main issues. What then? You could ignore\\nthose points, but that wouldn’t help Acme. You could make them\\nissues in their own right, but then you would have too many issues.\\nA good McKinsey issue list contains neither fewer than two nor\\nmore than five top-line issues (of course, three is best).\\n\\nThere  is  a  solution  to  this  dilemma—the  magical  category\\n“Other Issues.” If you can’t figure out where to put those two or\\nthree brilliant ideas, there is always Other Issues. There is a caveat,\\nhowever. Avoid using Other Issues in your top-line list—it looks out\\nof place. It’s fine lumped in among a bunch of subissues, but on the', 'fit those brilliant ideas into your top-line issues. Chances are you\\ncan. Still, if all else fails, Other Issues will help you stay MECE.\\n\\nSOLVE THE PROBLEM AT THE FIRST \\nMEETING—THE INITIAL HYPOTHESIS\\nSolving a complex problem is like embarking on a long jour-\\nney. The initial hypothesis is your problem-solving map.\\n\\nThe initial hypothesis (IH), the third pillar of the McKinsey prob-\\nlem-solving process, is the most difficult to explain. To make the\\nexplanation easier for you (and me), I will break this section into\\nthree parts:\\n\\n\\x0cBuilding the Solution\\n\\n9\\n\\n• Defining the initial hypothesis.\\n• Generating the initial hypothesis.\\n• Testing the initial hypothesis.\\n\\nDEFINING THE INITIAL HYPOTHESIS\\nThe essence of the initial hypothesis is “Figure out the solution to\\nthe problem before you start.” This seems counterintuitive, yet you\\ndo it all the time.\\n\\nSuppose you have to drive to a restaurant in a part of town you\\ndon’t know. You know you have to make the third left off Smith\\nStreet and then take the first right; it’s just after that corner. You\\nknow how to get to Smith Street; you’ll just follow your directions', '\\nSolving business problems is more complicated than finding a\\nrestaurant, but the initial hypothesis works the same way. It is a road\\nmap, albeit hastily sketched, to take you from problem to solution. If\\nyour IH is correct, then solving the problem means filling in the details\\nof the map through factual analysis. \\n\\nLet’s return to Acme Widgets from the last section. You and your\\nteam must find a way to increase sales at the widget business unit.\\nAfter you’ve brainstormed using your knowledge of the widget busi-\\nness, but before you’ve spent a lot of time gathering and analyzing\\nthe facts, you might come up with the following top-line IH:\\n\\nWe can increase widget sales by:\\n\\n• Changing the way we sell our widgets to retail outlets.\\n• Improving the way we market our widgets to consumers. \\n• Reducing the unit cost of our widgets.\\n\\nAs I will show in the next section, you would then take each issue\\ndown to another level or two of detail to determine which analyses\\nyou need in order to prove or disprove each hypothesis.\\n\\nRemember that a hypothesis is merely a theory to be proved\\n\\n\\x0c10\\n\\nThinking About Business Problems\\n\\nor disproved. It is not the answer. If your IH is correct, then, a few', 'tion. If it turns out to be wrong, then, by proving it wrong, you will\\nhave enough information to move toward the right answer. By\\nputting your IH down on paper, and determining how you can\\nprove or disprove it, you have set up a road map that you can fol-\\nlow to an eventual proved solution.\\n\\nGENERATING THE INITIAL HYPOTHESIS\\nThe IH emerges from the combination of facts and structure. There-\\nfore, as the first step in generating an IH, you must start with the\\nfacts. Remember, however, that you don’t want to do a lot of dig-\\nging around for information before you know where to dig. One\\nformer McKinsey SEM had a good approach for generating IHs:\\n\\nAt the start of an engagement, I would just try to digest as\\nmuch of our fact base as possible. I would sit down with the\\ntrade publications in that industry for an hour or two—not\\nso much to gather facts as to absorb something of the fla-\\nvor of that industry: what the jargon is, what the current\\nindustry issues are. I would especially seek out people in the\\nFirm who knew about this particular industry. That was the\\nquickest, most efficient way to get up to speed.', 'When generating an initial hypothesis, you don’t need all the\\nfacts, just enough to have a good overview of the industry and the\\nproblem. If the problem is in your own business, you may already\\nhave the facts in your head. That’s great, but facts are not enough.\\nYou have to apply structure to them.\\n\\nTo structure your IH begin by breaking the problem into its\\ncomponents—the  key  drivers  (see  “Find  the  Key  Drivers,”  in\\nChapter 3). Next, make an actionable recommendation regarding\\neach driver. This is extremely important. Suppose your business’s\\n\\n\\x0cBuilding the Solution\\n\\n11\\n\\nprofits are greatly affected by the weather; in fact, it is the key\\ndeterminant of profits in a given quarter. “We have to pray for\\ngood weather” is not an actionable recommendation. On the other\\nhand,  “We  must  reduce  our  vulnerability  to  changes  in  the\\nweather” is an actionable, top-line recommendation. \\n\\nFor your next step, you must take each top-line recommenda-\\ntion and break it down to the level of issues. If a given recommen-\\ndation is correct, what issues does it raise? Consider the likely', 'what analyses would you need to make to prove or disprove your\\nhypothesis? With a little experience, and a lot of debate within\\nyour team, you should get a good sense of what is provable and\\nwhat is not. This will help you avoid blind alleys. \\n\\nIn the Acme Widgets problem, suppose your team decided that\\nthe key drivers were the sales force, the consumer marketing strat-\\negy, and production costs. You then came up with a list of action-\\nable, top-line recommendations as your initial hypothesis:\\n\\nWe can increase widget sales by:\\n\\n• Changing the way we sell our widgets to retail outlets.\\n• Improving the way we market our widgets to consumers. \\n• Reducing the unit cost of our widgets.\\n\\nLet’s begin with a closer look at the sales force. It’s organized geo-\\ngraphically (Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, etc.) and sells pri-\\nmarily  to  three  types  of  retail  outlets:  superstores,  department\\nstores, and specialty stores. The team believes that the sales force\\nought to be organized by customer type—that’s one issue. \\n\\nWhat analyses could prove or disprove that belief? You could\\nbreak out the sales by customer type for each region. If penetra-', 'region and higher than for the other types of retail outlets, find\\nout why. When you talk to the Northeast sales reps, you might\\n\\n\\x0c12\\n\\nThinking About Business Problems\\n\\nfind that they have a better feel for superstores than any other\\nsales team. What if they were put in charge of all superstores\\nacross  the  country  and  achieved  the  same  penetration?  What\\nwould that mean for widget sales? \\n\\nThe end product of this exercise is what McKinsey calls the issue\\ntree.  In  other  words,  you  start  with  your  initial  hypothesis  and\\nbranch out at each issue. The result looks like the figure below.\\n\\nWhen you’ve completed your issue tree, you have your prob-\\nlem-solving map. That’s the easy part. The difficult part will come\\nwhen you have to dig deep to prove your hypothesis.\\n\\nISSUE TREE FOR ACME WIDGETS\\n\\nChange \\nSales\\nStrategy\\n\\nIncrease \\nWidget\\nSales\\n\\nImprove \\nMarketing\\nStrategy\\n\\nSales Force\\nOrganization\\n\\nSales Force\\nSkill Base\\n\\nPromotion\\nStrategy\\n\\nProduct Quality\\n\\nPackaging\\n\\nConsumer \\nAdvertising\\nStrategy\\n\\nRaw Materials \\nSourcing\\n\\nReduce \\nUnit Cost\\n\\nProduction Process\\n', '\\n\\x0cBuilding the Solution\\n\\n13\\n\\nTESTING THE INITIAL HYPOTHESIS\\nBefore you take your problem-solving map out on the road, you\\nwant (forgive the mixed metaphor) to kick the tires on it. Test\\nit. Is it the best possible hypothesis you could devise, given what\\nyou know about the industry and your client or company? Have\\nyou thought about all the issues? Have you considered all the \\ndrivers of the problem? Are all your recommendations actionable\\nand provable? \\n\\nWhen I discussed generating an IH, I used the phrase “your\\nteam” rather than “you.” My experience at the Firm (and that\\nof the many McKinsey alumni I interviewed for this book) taught\\nme that IHs produced by teams are much stronger than those\\nproduced by individuals. Why? Most of us are poor critics of our\\nown thinking. We need others to pick apart our ideas. A team of\\nthree or four bright individuals is an excellent vehicle for that.\\n\\nSo when your team meets to come up with an IH let a thou-\\nsand flowers bloom. Everyone should have his or her own ideas\\nand initial hypotheses. Everyone should be prepared to push a\\nteammate’s thinking and test each new idea. If you are the team', 'different approach from whatever has just been said. Ask, “What\\nif we change this? What if we push that? How about looking at it\\nthis way?” The process involves shooting a certain amount of\\nbull. That’s OK, have fun—as long as it pushes your thinking.\\n(For more ideas and techniques to push your team’s thinking, see\\nChapter 9.)\\n\\n\\x0cThis page intentionally left blank.\\n\\n\\x0c2\\n\\nDEVELOPING AN APPROACH\\n\\nJust knowing the essence of the McKinsey problem-solving\\nprocess does not mean you can now go forth and conquer\\nthe  business  world  by  being  fact-based,  structured,  and\\nhypothesis-driven.

He will tell the doctor about his symptoms: scratchy\\nthroat, achy head, and runny nose. The doctor will not immedi-\\nately trust the patient’s conclusion. She will take the patient’s his-\\ntory, ask some probing questions, and then make her diagnosis.\\nThe patient may have the flu, or a cold, or something more serious,\\nbut the doctor will not rely on the patient to diagnose himself.\\n\\nAt McKinsey, we found that clients were often no better at\\ndiagnosing themselves than a doctor’s patients. Sometimes, prob-\\nlems would come to us in extremely vague formulations. In my\\nfirst study at the Firm, our team’s mission was to help a New York\\ninvestment bank “increase profitability”—the business equivalent\\nof a patient telling the doctor “I don’t feel well.” In another case,\\na McKinsey team went in to evaluate expansion opportunities for', 'ering and analyzing data, the team realized that what the division\\nneeded was not expansion; it was closure or sell-off.\\n\\nThe only way to figure out if the problem you have been given\\nis the real problem is to dig deeper. Get facts. Ask questions. Poke\\naround. It usually does not take very long to figure out if you are\\nheading down the right path, and the time you take up front will\\n\\n\\x0cDeveloping an Approach\\n\\n17\\n\\nmore than make up for itself in time you don’t waste further down\\nthe line.\\n\\nWhat do you do when you are convinced you are working on\\nthe wrong problem? When a doctor thinks that a patient’s minor\\nsymptoms mask something more serious, she will tell her patient,\\n“Mr. Jones, I can treat your headache, but I think it’s a symptom of\\nsomething more serious and I’d like to do further tests.” In the\\nsame way, you should go back to your client, or your boss—who-\\never it was that asked for your input in the first place—and say,\\n“You asked me to look at problem X, but the real impact on our\\nperformance will come from solving problem Y. Now I can solve\\nproblem X, if that’s what you really want, but I think it’s in our', 'client can either accept your recommendation or tell you to stay on\\nthe original problem, but you will have fulfilled your responsibility\\nto act in the client’s best interests.\\n\\nDON’T REINVENT THE WHEEL (PART 1)\\nMost business problems resemble each other more than they\\ndiffer. This means that with a small number of problem-solv-\\ning techniques, you can answer a broad range of questions.\\nThese techniques may be somewhere in your organization,\\neither written down or in the heads of your fellow employees.\\nIf not, use your experience to develop your own tool kit.\\n\\nMcKinsey, like every other consulting firm, has developed a num-\\nber  of  problem-solving  methods  and  given  them  fancy  names:\\nAnalysis of Value Added, Business Process Redesign, Product-Mar-\\n\\n\\x0c18\\n\\nThinking About Business Problems\\n\\nket Scan, and so on. These techniques are immensely powerful.\\nThey allow McKinsey consultants very rapidly to fit the raw data\\nthat lands on their desks into a coherent framework and give them\\ninsights into the nature of the client’s problem. The consultants can\\nthen focus their thinking on the “drivers” of the problem and start\\nworking toward a solution. \\n\\nWe made frequent use of an analytical framework called Forces', 'in helping us look at the likely external pressures on the client. The\\ntechnique involves identifying the client’s suppliers, customers,\\ncompetitors, and possible substitute products. We then list all the\\nchanges occurring in each of the four categories. What impact—\\npositive or negative—could these have on our client? Also, what\\ninternal changes are affecting the client and the client’s industry?\\nWhich of these factors could actually cause major changes to the\\nway the client designs, manufactures, distributes, sells, and services\\nits products? \\n\\nWhatever business you’re in, this framework will not only help\\nyou build a snapshot of your competitive environment, but also\\nhelp you develop a view of how that environment might change.\\nTry it. It sounds simple, but it is a powerful way to stimulate your\\nthinking about strategic business problems.\\n\\nThese frameworks really help at the start of the problem-solv-\\ning process. For instance, when I was a second-year associate, I\\njoined a team that was helping a major Wall Street investment\\nbank reorganize its information technology department. All the\\nexecutives at the bank wanted IT reorganized, but not if it meant\\nany changes in the way their computers were supported. The IT\\ndepartment was a real mess, with 600 employees, a dozen different', 'my head spin. \\n\\nI (and the rest of the team) hardly knew where to begin. For-\\n\\n\\x0cDeveloping an Approach\\n\\n19\\n\\ntunately, the Firm had recently developed a new paradigm, called\\nBusiness Process Redesign, that gave us a starting point. The Firm\\nwas still coming to grips with BPR, and during the study we broke\\nnew ground for the Firm. It was hard work, but BPR (along with\\na lot of sweat, Chinese food, and late nights) helped us help the\\nclient force through the reorganization. If we had not had at least\\na starting framework to help us focus our efforts, we might never\\nhave left the ground.\\n\\n. . . BUT EVERY CLIENT IS UNIQUE \\n(NO COOKIE-CUTTER SOLUTIONS)\\nThat there are many similarities between business problems\\ndoes not mean that similar problems have similar solutions.\\nYou have to validate your initial hypothesis (or your gut)\\nwith fact-based analysis. This will put you in a much better\\nposition to get your ideas accepted.\\n\\nIf all you have is a hammer, then every problem looks like a nail.\\nCritics of McKinsey (and management consulting in general) say\\nthat the Firm bases its solutions on the most current management\\nfad—the favorite tool in its intellectual toolbox. ', 'At the Firm, at least, this is untrue. Fact-based analysis as prac-\\nticed by McKinsey requires hard proof before any recommenda-\\ntions are made to clients. Jason Klein, a former SEM at McKinsey\\nand now publisher of Field & Stream and Outdoor Life, puts it\\nlike this:\\n\\nPeople think that the Firm—and management consultants in\\ngeneral—have a precanned answer. That is certainly not the\\n\\n\\x0c20\\n\\nThinking About Business Problems\\n\\ncase at McKinsey; if it were, then the Firm would not be as\\nsuccessful as it is.\\n\\nThe tools may be the same from problem to problem,\\nbut you have to apply them. For instance, in my experience,\\nin 8 out of 10 pricing problems the answer turns out to be\\n“raise  your  prices.”  If  you  do  the  fact-based  analysis—\\ndemand curves, breakeven calculations, budgets—enough\\ntimes, you see almost invariably that firms should be rais-\\ning  their  prices.  But  if  you  automatically  say  that’s  the\\nanswer, you’ll get into trouble, because you’ll run into an\\ninstance where the answer is really “lower your prices.”\\n\\nAs a corollary to avoiding cookie-cutter solutions, be careful', 'as you see and solve more and more problems, you will get a fair\\nidea of what works in your industry and what doesn’t. Although\\nyour gut will often be right, take a hint from former President Rea-\\ngan: “Trust and verify.” As a McKinsey alumnus who now works\\nas a merchant banker put it:\\n\\nA sharp manager with a lot of business experience can often\\nreach the same conclusions as McKinsey—and in a much\\nshorter time—by gut instinct, but most executives aren’t that\\ngood. Because McKinsey focuses so intently on a problem,\\nit often produces a more robust solution than even the best\\nexecutive  can.  Most  executives  will  miss  a  few  things\\nbecause they don’t take the time—they usually don’t have\\nthe time.\\n\\nSo, even though your initial instinct may be—and probably is\\n\\n—right, take enough time to verify your gut with facts.\\n\\n\\x0cDeveloping an Approach\\n\\n21\\n\\nDON’T MAKE THE FACTS FIT\\nYOUR SOLUTION\\nAvoid the temptation to view your initial hypothesis as the\\nanswer  and  the  problem-solving  process  as  an  exercise \\nin proving the IH. Keep an open and flexible mind. Don’t', 'tal inflexibility.\\n\\nOn  an  engagement  for  a  major  insurance  company,  the  EM\\nassured his team and the client that the key to restoring the client’s\\nprofitability was eliminating “leakage”—the acceptance of cus-\\ntomer claims without adjustment. He assigned a new associate to\\ndetermine the rate of leakage in fire insurance claims over the pre-\\nvious three years. As any good McKinsey associate would, this\\nyoung man applied himself tirelessly and diligently to his task. He\\ncombed through stacks of claims in search of leakage. The result:\\nvery little leakage, far less than the EM had predicted. \\n\\nRather than take these data for what they were—an indication\\nthat he needed to reexamine his hypothesis—the EM simply told\\nthe young associate to look again, this time in auto insurance . . .\\nand  then  in  marine  insurance  .  .  .    and  in  business  insurance.\\nNowhere were the expected rates of leakage to be found. \\n\\nOne day, the EM was sitting in the team’s on-site HQ looking\\nslightly despondent. The team’s main contact at the client poked\\nhis head around the doorpost. “What’s the matter, Nick?” he said.', '\\nThe moral of this little tale is that, no matter how brilliant,\\ninsightful, and original you may feel your initial hypothesis to be,\\nyou must always be prepared to accept that the facts may prove\\n\\n\\x0c22\\n\\nThinking About Business Problems\\n\\nyou wrong. If they do, adjust to the facts. Don’t try to pound them\\ninto your framework like square pegs into round holes.\\n\\nHow do you avoid that trap? The McKinsey way is to take an\\noccasional step back from the continual grind of fact gathering and\\nanalysis and to ask yourself what you have learned over the past\\nweek (or two weeks, or whatever). How does the new informa-\\ntion fit into your initial hypothesis? If it doesn’t, how might it\\nchange that hypothesis? Doing these little reality checks now and\\nthen could save you from chasing down blind alleys.\\n\\nAs a final note, I should add that the story, although true, rep-\\nresents the exception rather than the rule at McKinsey, at least in\\nmy experience. And that EM has long since left the Firm.\\n\\nMAKE SURE YOUR SOLUTION FITS \\nYOUR CLIENT\\nThe most brilliant solution, backed up by libraries of data\\nand promising billions in extra profits, is useless if your client', 'organization’s strengths, weaknesses, and capabilities—what\\nmanagement can and cannot do. Tailor your solutions with\\nthese factors in mind.\\n\\nA  former  McKinsey  EM  who  now  works  on  Wall  Street  tells \\nthis story:\\n\\nWe were doing a cost cutting study for a large financial insti-\\ntution. We discovered that they were in the midst of linking\\nall  their  offices—they  had  several  hundred  around  the\\nworld—by satellite. This project had begun several years\\n\\n\\x0cDeveloping an Approach\\n\\n23\\n\\npreviously, and they had managed so far to roll it out to\\nabout half their offices.\\n\\nWe determined that with currently available technology\\nthey could do the same thing for a fraction of the cost using\\nconventional phone lines. By our calculations, they would\\nhave saved $170 million on a present value basis.\\n\\nWe took our findings to the senior manager overseeing\\nthe engagement, the man who had brought us in to begin\\nwith, and he said, “Well, that’s terrific. We appreciate that\\nit could have saved us a few hundred million dollars, but\\nwe’ve already started down this road and, politically, it’s just\\ntoo risky. You have to realize that we only have a certain', 'ideas that are bigger than this.”\\n\\nAt one level, it’s unbelievable that he didn’t accept our\\nidea. But on another level, we were coming up with other\\nsuggestions that would save the organization half a billion or\\na billion dollars. So this was, if not exactly chicken feed, just\\na medium-size payoff for them. It’s a rational response. If I\\ncan do only three things, I’ll do the three biggest.\\n\\nMcKinsey hires people with stellar academic records and\\nenforces a rigorous discipline in analyzing problems and struc-\\nturing solutions. Because of this, a McKinsey-ite’s (especially a\\nnew hire’s) first instinct is to go hell for leather after the very\\nbest solution. \\n\\nUnfortunately, when academic ideals meet business realities,\\nbusiness realities usually win. Businesses are full of real people,\\nwith real strengths and weaknesses and limitations. These people\\ncan do only so much with the finite resources available in their\\norganizations. Some things they just cannot do, whether for polit-\\nical reasons, lack of resources or inability. \\n\\n\\x0c24\\n\\nThinking About Business Problems\\n\\nAs a consultant, you bear the responsibility for knowing the\\nlimitations of your client; if your client is your own employer—or\\nyour own business—that responsibility is doubled. Knowing those', 'make fit within them.\\n\\nSOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO LET THE \\nSOLUTION COME TO YOU\\nThe McKinsey rules of problem solving, like all rules, have\\ntheir  exceptions.  You  will  not  be  able  to  form  an  initial\\nhypothesis every time. Sometimes, the client will not know\\nwhat  the  problem  is,  just  that  there  is  a  problem.  Other\\ntimes,  the  scope  of  your  project  will  be  so  large—or  so\\nvague—that starting with an IH will be worthless. Still other\\ntimes, you will be breaking new ground and nothing in your\\nexperience will point to a solution. Don’t panic! If you get\\nyour facts together and do your analyses, the solution will\\ncome to you.\\n\\nHamish McDermott, former EM at the Firm, recounted this story:\\n\\nI was on a study where we were trying to improve the per-\\nformance of the foreign exchange business of a major bank;\\nwe were supposed to reduce costs in the back-office opera-\\ntion by 30 percent. I had nothing at that stage that I could\\npoint to, no initial hypothesis about how to get those costs', 'how the back-office processing worked. \\n\\n\\x0cDeveloping an Approach\\n\\n25\\n\\nI had to interview the woman in charge of back-office\\nprocessing along with her senior staff. She didn’t mean to be\\nunpleasant, although it certainly felt that way, but she came\\nright out and said, “You’ve never done this before and you\\nknow nothing about this business. One of two things is\\ngoing to happen. Either you’ll come back with something\\nwe don’t agree with, which will necessarily be wrong, or\\nyou’ll listen to us and come back with what we already\\nknow, in which case you’ve added no value. We understand\\nthat you’re here and that you’re working on this, but from\\nour  point  of  view  it’s  a  total  waste  of  our  time  and  the\\nbank’s money.”\\n\\nStill, she gave us the data we asked for. It turned out that\\none product, which represented about 5 percent of their\\nbusiness, was producing about 50 percent of their costs. We\\nwere able to fix that. They’d had no idea this was going on.\\nIn subsequent stages of the engagement, we were able to\\nextend this analysis to other parts of the business and we eas-', '\\nThe moral of this story is that an initial hypothesis is not a pre-\\nrequisite for successful problem solving. Having one will help orga-\\nnize and forward your thinking, but if you can’t come up with one,\\ndon’t  despair.  Any  McKinsey-ite  will  tell  you  that  no  business\\nproblem  is  immune  to  the  power  of  fact-based  analysis.  Put\\ntogether enough facts, combine them with some creative thinking,\\nand you will come up with a solution.\\n\\n\\x0c26\\n\\nThinking About Business Problems\\n\\nSOME PROBLEMS YOU JUST CAN’T SOLVE . . .\\nSOLVE THEM ANYWAY\\nEventually, you will run into a brick wall that is tougher than\\nyour head.

The client, a major\\nfinancial institution in the midst of reorganizing its investment\\nmanagement business, faced severe challenges of heroic dimen-\\nsions: thousands of employees, billions of dollars. The McKinsey\\nteam included my mentor and my favorite EM. It seemed the per-', '\\nThe recipe might have been right, but the result left a bad taste\\nin our mouths. Factions within the client’s senior management pre-\\nvented us from doing our job. Data we asked for arrived late, or\\nin an unusable form or not at all. People we needed to interview\\nrefused to speak with us. The members of the client team vigor-\\nously pursued their own agendas at the expense of reaching a solu-\\ntion. We spent several uncomfortable months on this study and,\\nin the end, had to make what recommendations we could, “declare\\nvictory,” and get out.\\n\\nMy team’s experience was hardly unique in the history of the\\nFirm. The road of problem solving is often strewn with obstacles.\\nData to prove your hypothesis may be missing or bad. Sometimes\\nbusinesses realize too late that they have a problem; by the time\\nMcKinsey,  or  anyone,  addresses  the  problem,  the  business  is\\nalready doomed. \\n\\nThe biggest obstacle—the troll guarding the bridge—is politics.\\n\\n\\x0cDeveloping an Approach\\n\\n27\\n\\nThe first thing to understand about politics—and how it can help\\nor hinder you from doing your job—is that businesses are full of\\nreal people. When you look at the boxes on an organization chart,', 'around, you change someone’s life. As one former McKinsey EM\\nremarked,  “Sometimes  change  management  means  just  that—\\nchanging management.”\\n\\nWhen  members  of  a  McKinsey  team  go  into  a  client,  they\\ncarry  change  with  them.  Some  at  the  client  will  welcome  the\\nbringers of change as white knights riding to the rescue; others\\nwill see McKinsey as an invading army to either flee or drive out,\\ndepending  on  their  power  in  the  organization.  As  one  former\\nMcKinsey-ite  put  it,  “It  was  a  rare  engagement  when  there \\nwasn’t at least one sector of the client organization that did not\\nwant us there and did not want us to come up with a real answer.” \\nIn most cases, when senior management brings in McKinsey,\\nenough players in the organization will cooperate willingly and\\nMcKinsey can be effective.

Sometimes you will come up\\nwith a great solution that you know the client organization can-\\nnot  implement.  This  is  especially  true  with  organizational\\nchange—it is easy to devise an optimal organization, but you usu-\\nally  have  to  deal  with  the  personnel  resources  that  the  client\\nalready has.

As\\npeople leave the organization, you can “tweak” your way to your', '\\nWork through the politics. Even political problems are solu-\\nble. Most people in business are rational, at least in their business\\nconduct. They react to incentives. Therefore, when you face polit-\\nical opposition, it usually means that your solution has negative\\nimplications for someone in the organization. So politics is just\\npeople acting in their own interests.\\n\\nTo work through the politics, you must think about how your\\nsolution affects the players in an organization. You must then build\\na consensus for change that takes account of the different incen-\\ntives and organizational factors driving the politics. Consensus\\nbuilding  may  require  you  to  change  your  solution  to  make  it\\nacceptable. Do it.

Call them my “Other Issues.”\\n\\nCopyright 1999 Ethan M. Rasiel.  Click here for Terms of Use.\\n\\n29\\n', '\\nThinking About Business Problems\\n\\n80/20\\nThe 80/20 rule is one of the great truths of management con-\\nsulting and, by extension, of business. You will see it wher-\\never you look: 80 percent of your sales will come from 20\\npercent of your sales force; 20 percent of a secretary’s job will\\ntake up 80 percent of her time; 20 percent of the population\\ncontrols 80 percent of the wealth. It doesn’t always work\\n(sometimes the bread falls butter-side up), but if you keep\\nyour eyes peeled for examples of 80/20 in your business, you\\nwill come up with ways to improve it.\\n\\nI saw the 80/20 rule at work all the time at McKinsey, and I’ve\\nalways been impressed by its power as a problem-solving rule \\nof thumb.\\n\\nIn my first-ever McKinsey study, when I was between years at\\nbusiness school, I joined a team working with a large New York\\nbrokerage  house.  The  board  of  directors  wanted  McKinsey  to\\nshow them how to improve the profitability of their institutional\\nequity brokerage business—the selling of stocks to large pension\\nfunds and mutual funds like Fidelity and T. Rowe Price. ', 'When a client asks the question “How do I boost my profits?”\\nthe first thing McKinsey does is take a step back and ask the ques-\\ntion “Where do your profits come from?” The answer to this is not\\nalways obvious, even to people who have been in their particular\\nbusiness for years. To answer this question for our client, our team\\nwent through every account of every broker and every trader by\\ncustomer. We spent several weeks analyzing this mountain of data\\nfrom every conceivable angle, but when we ran the numbers there\\nare some of the first things we saw:\\n\\n\\x0c80/20 and Other Rules to Live By\\n\\n31\\n\\n•  80 percent of the sales came from 20 percent of the \\n\\nbrokers.\\n\\n•  80 percent of the orders came from 20 percent of the \\n\\ncustomers.\\n\\n•  80 percent of the trading profit came from 20 percent \\n\\nof the traders.\\n\\nThese results pointed to some serious problems in the way the\\nclient allocated its staff resources, and we focused on those like a\\nlaser. Once we started digging, we found that the situation was\\nmore complex than simply “80 percent of the sales staff is lazy or\\nincompetent” (not that we ever thought that was the case to begin', 'top brokers handled the 10 biggest accounts. By sharing these big\\naccounts out among more brokers, and by dedicating one senior\\nand one junior broker to each of the three largest customers, we\\nactually increased total sales from these accounts. Rather than\\ndivide up the pie more fairly, we increased the size of the pie. Thus,\\n80/20 gave us a jump-start in solving the client’s problem.\\n\\n80/20 is all about data. What are your sales figures by product?\\nWhat is your margin by product? How does each member of your\\nsales team perform in terms of sales? In terms of profits? What is\\nthe success rate of your research teams? What is the geographical\\ndistribution of your customers? If you know your business well\\n(and you’d better if you want to survive), then you know the right\\nquestions to ask. When you have your data, put it on a spreadsheet\\nor in a database. Sort it in various ways. Play with the numbers.\\nYou will begin to see patterns, clumps that stand out. Those pat-\\nterns will highlight aspects of your business that you probably did\\nnot realize. They may mean problems (a big problem if 80 percent\\nof your profits come from 20 percent of your product lines), but', 'most of them.\\n\\n\\x0c32\\n\\nThinking About Business Problems\\n\\nDON’T BOIL THE OCEAN\\nWork smarter, not harder. There’s a lot of data out there\\nrelating to your problem, and a lot of analyses you could do.\\nIgnore most of them. \\n\\nMcKinsey gathers enough facts to prove or disprove a hypothe-\\nsis  or  support  or  refute  an  analysis—and  only  enough  facts. \\nThis is the flip side of fact-based analysis in a business situa-\\ntion. Anything more is a waste of time and effort when both are\\nprecious commodities.\\n\\nI had this lesson brought home to me late one night while I was\\ndrafting a “fact pack” on a client’s competitor. I had gathered a\\nmountain of data and was trying to wring out a few new insights\\nfrom it. My EM, Vik, walked into my office, briefcase and coat in\\nhand, and asked how my work was going. I told him it was going\\nwell, but I thought I could pull together a few more charts. He\\npicked up my draft, leafed through it, and said, “Ethan, it’s eleven\\no’clock. The client will love this. No one will be able to absorb', 'shared a cab home.\\n\\n“Don’t boil the ocean” means don’t try to analyze everything.\\nBe selective; figure out the priorities of what you are doing. Know\\nwhen you have done enough, then stop. Otherwise, you will spend\\na lot of time and effort for very little return, like boiling the ocean\\nto get a handful of salt.\\n\\n\\x0c80/20 and Other Rules to Live By\\n\\n33\\n\\nFIND THE KEY DRIVERS\\nMany factors affect your business. Focus on the most impor-\\ntant ones—the key drivers.\\n\\nIn any McKinsey team meeting where problem solving is on the\\nagenda, someone will use the inelegant phrase “key drivers,” as\\nin, “Vik, I think these are the key drivers of this issue.” In other\\nwords, there may be a 100 different factors affecting the sales of\\nour widgets—weather, consumer confidence, raw material prices—\\nbut the three most important ones are X, Y, and Z. We’ll ignore \\nthe rest.\\n\\nEngineers learn something called the Square Law of Compu-\\ntation. It states that for every component of a system—for every\\nadditional equation in a problem—the amount of computation\\nrequired to solve the system increases at least as fast as the square', 'your problem doubles, the time it takes to solve it quadruples—\\nunless you make some simplifications. For example, our solar sys-\\ntem contains millions of objects, all having gravitational effects\\non one another. When analyzing planetary motion, astronomers\\nstart by ignoring most of these objects.*\\n\\nFocusing on the key drivers means drilling down to the core\\nof the problem, rather than picking the whole problem apart piece\\nby piece, layer by layer. Then, you can apply thorough, fact-based\\nanalysis where it will do the most good and avoid going down\\nblind alleys.\\n\\n*For an in-depth discussion of the square law of computation and other issues of complex-\\nity and problem solving, see Gerald M. Weinberg, An Introduction to General Systems\\nThinking (New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1975).\\n\\n\\x0c34\\n\\nThinking About Business Problems\\n\\nSyntactical foibles aside, “key drivers” is a very powerful con-\\ncept. It saves you time. It saves you effort. It keeps you from boil-\\ning the ocean.\\n\\nTHE ELEVATOR TEST\\nKnow your solution (or your product or business) so thor-\\noughly that you can explain it clearly and precisely to your\\nclient (or customer or investor) in 30 seconds. If you can do', 'sell your solution.\\n\\nImagine it’s time for that big, end-of-engagement presentation. You\\nand your team have been up until 2 a.m. putting together your blue\\nbooks,*  making  sure  that  every  i has  been  dotted  and  every  t\\ncrossed. You’re all wearing your best suits and trying to look on the\\nball. The senior executives of your Fortune 50 client, anxious to\\nhear McKinsey’s words of wisdom, are taking their places around\\nthe boardroom table on the top floor of the corporate skyscraper.\\nThe CEO strides into the room and says, “Sorry, folks. I can’t stay.\\nWe have a crisis and I have to go meet with our lawyers.” Then he\\nturns to you and says, “Why don’t you ride down in the elevator\\nwith me and tell me what you’ve found out?” The ride will take\\nabout 30 seconds. In that time, can you tell the CEO your solution?\\nCan you sell him your solution? That’s the elevator test.\\n\\nMany companies use the elevator test (or something similar)\\nbecause it’s an excellent way of making sure that their executives’\\n\\n*A McKinsey presentation document so called because it is bound with blue cardboard', '\\n\\x0c80/20 and Other Rules to Live By\\n\\n35\\n\\ntime gets used efficiently. Procter & Gamble tells its managers to\\nwrite one-page memos. A Hollywood producer will tell a screen-\\nwriter to “give me the bullet” on a new script; if, after 30 seconds,\\nthe producer likes what she’s heard, the writer will get a chance\\nto talk further, and maybe make a sale. Jason Klein instituted the\\nelevator test when he took over as president of Field & Stream:\\n\\nMy sales force could not explain the magazine to customers.\\nOur advertisement space was shrinking. Then I trained my\\nentire sales force on the elevator test. I challenged them to\\nexplain the magazine to me in 30 seconds. It became a valu-\\nable tool for them, and our ad base has grown every year.\\n\\nHow do you encapsulate six months’ work in 30 seconds?\\nStart with the issues that your team addressed. The client wants\\nto  know  the  recommendations  for  each  issue  and  the  payoff. \\nIf you have a lot of recommendations, stick to the three most\\nimportant—the  ones  with  the  biggest  payoffs.  Don’t  worry \\nabout the supporting data; you can talk about that when you', '\\nFor example, your analysis shows that a manufacturing client\\ncan’t sell enough widgets because its sales force is organized by ter-\\nritory when it should be organized by buyer category. You have\\nlots of data illustrating this: analyses of salespeople by buyer type,\\nbuyer interviews, field visits to retail and wholesale outlets, and\\nso forth. When you’re on that elevator ride, just tell the CEO, “We\\nthink you can boost sales of widgets by 50 percent in three years\\nif you reorganize your sales force by buyer category. We can talk\\nabout the details later. Good luck with the lawyers.”\\n\\n\\x0c36\\n\\nThinking About Business Problems\\n\\nPLUCK THE LOW-HANGING FRUIT\\nSometimes  in  the  middle  of  the  problem-solving  process,\\nopportunities arise to get an easy win, to make immediate\\nimprovements,  even  before  the  overall  problem  has  been\\nsolved. Seize those opportunities! They create little victories\\nfor  you  and  your  team.  They  boost  morale  and  give  you\\nadded credibility by showing anybody who may be watch-\\ning that you’re on the ball and mean business.\\n\\nWhenever possible, McKinsey consultants put this doctrine into', 'months (or more) that a big McKinsey engagement can last. Giving\\nthe client something practical before the end helps reduce the pres-\\nsure on the team. \\n\\nAt my stockbroker client, after we had derived a number of\\ninsights (thanks to 80/20) from our analysis of sales and trading\\ndata, we wanted to communicate our findings to the senior man-\\nagers of the institutional equities department. We set up a meeting\\nwith the department head and the heads of all the business units\\nin the division: sales, trading, research, and so on. \\n\\nSince I had taken the lead in the actual analysis of the data, I\\ngot to present our findings. They hit this group of very experienced\\nWall Street executives like a hammer. The client had no idea just\\nhow inefficient its operation was. \\n\\nThe presentation had two important effects. First, it convinced\\nthose executives who had not been particularly keen on McKin-\\nsey’s presence in the first place that they had a problem and we\\ncould help solve it. Second, because I had presented the findings,\\ntheir opinion of me rose quite sharply and my job became a lot eas-\\n\\n\\x0c80/20 and Other Rules to Live By\\n\\n37\\n\\nier. Before the meeting, I was some smart-ass MBA poking around', 'ing for them to solve their problems.\\n\\nBy plucking the low-hanging fruit, by resisting the temptation\\nto hoard our information until some big end-of-study presentation,\\nwe made our client more enthusiastic, our jobs easier, and our-\\nselves happier.\\n\\nThis rule is really about satisfying your customer in a long-\\nterm relationship. Your customer could be the purchaser of your\\nproducts, or it could be a client for your services, or it could be\\nyour boss. Whoever it is, it pays to keep him happy and let him\\nknow that he is your top priority. If you are on, say, a software\\ndesign  project  with  a  three-month  lead  time  and  you’ve  put\\ntogether a usable program that solves part of the problem in two\\nweeks, show it to your boss. Don’t wait! Solving only part of a\\nproblem can still mean increased profits. Just don’t let anybody\\nthink you’ve given up on a complete solution. Those little wins\\nhelp you and your customers.\\n\\nMAKE A CHART EVERY DAY \\nDuring the problem-solving process, you learn something\\nnew every day. Put it down on paper. It will help you push\\nyour thinking. You may use it, or you may not, but once you', '\\nMaking a chart every day may strike you as somewhat anal-reten-\\ntive. It is. Then again, when you are trying to craft facts into solu-\\ntions, that is not so bad.\\n\\n\\x0c38\\n\\nThinking About Business Problems\\n\\nIn the course of a typical day at McKinsey, you could start with\\na quick brainstorming session at 9 a.m., move on to a client inter-\\nview at 10, a factory tour at 11, and then a sandwich lunch with\\nyour director. You might follow this with more client interviews,\\nan end-of-day team meeting, and then a quick trip down to Whar-\\nton to participate in a recruiting seminar. In the midst of all this,\\nit is very easy for the facts to blend into one another like pools of\\ndifferent-colored inks on a sheet of blotting paper. Even if you take\\ngood notes at your interviews and have the minutes of your team\\nmeetings, important points could get lost.\\n\\nYou can avoid this by sitting down for half an hour at the end\\nof the day and asking yourself, “What are the three most impor-\\ntant things I learned today?” Put them down in a chart or two—\\nnothing  fancy;  neatness  doesn’t  count.  If  the  facts  don’t  lend', 'thing in charts), just write them down as bullet points. Put your\\nresults someplace where they won’t get lost—don’t just toss them\\ninto your in-tray. Later, when you are in analysis mode, you can\\ncome back to your charts and notes and think about what they\\nmean and where they fit in terms of your solution.\\n\\nOf course, this little tip can be taken too far. One EM from\\nGermany, while working out of the New York office, would write\\na whole presentation every night. I wouldn’t recommend this for\\nmost people—at least those with a life. Then again, the EM was far\\nfrom home, didn’t know anyone in town, and had nothing better\\nto do. He should have followed some of the suggestions presented\\nin Part Four.\\n\\n\\x0c80/20 and Other Rules to Live By\\n\\n39\\n\\nHIT SINGLES\\nYou can’t do everything, so don’t try. Just do what you’re\\nsupposed to do and get it right. It’s much better to get to first\\nbase consistently than to try to hit a home run—and strike\\nout 9 times out of 10.\\n\\nShortly after I joined McKinsey, the New York office held a retreat\\nat a resort upstate. One day we associates had to interrupt our', 'ture (hey, you have to do some work at these things). The speaker\\nwas the CEO of a major electronics company, a client of the Firm,\\nand a McKinsey alumnus himself. His main message was “Don’t\\ntry to knock the ball out of the park. Hit singles. Get your job\\ndone—don’t try to do the work of the whole team.”\\n\\nHis  speech  took  me  by  surprise.  McKinsey  associates  have\\nspent their whole lives “knocking it out of the park.” They all have\\nfirst-class  academic  backgrounds  combined  with  records  of\\nachievement in other fields. They had to impress a group of sharp-\\neyed and skeptical McKinsey consultants just to make it past the\\nfirst job interview at the Firm. To gear down upon joining would\\nstrike most of them as strange, if not distasteful.\\n\\nIt took several years of gaining perspective before I understood\\nthe  wisdom  of  the  CEO’s  words.  There  are  three  reasons  he \\nwas right:\\n\\n•  It’s impossible to do everything yourself all the time.\\n•  If you manage it once, you raise unrealistic expectations \\n\\nfrom those around you.\\n\\n•  Once you fail to meet expectations, it is very difficult to ', 'regain credibility.\\n\\n\\x0c40\\n\\nThinking About Business Problems\\n\\nIt’s impossible to do everything yourself all the time. Business\\nproblems are complicated—the problems McKinsey deals with espe-\\ncially so. If you don’t leverage the other members of your team to\\nsolve these problems, you are wasting valuable resources. The prin-\\nciple applies as much to senior managers as to junior executives\\nwhose MBA diplomas are still wet with ink. Very few people have\\nthe brainpower and energy to be a one-man show all the time.\\n\\nIf you manage it once, you raise unrealistic expectations from\\nthose  around  you. Suppose,  for  a  moment,  that  you  manage,\\nthrough superhuman effort, to perform well beyond what is nor-\\nmally expected of you. You hit that ball out of the park and (what\\nthe heck) the bases were loaded. Congratulations. Of course, now\\nyour boss or your shareholders will expect you to do the same\\nthing every time you step up to the plate. \\n\\nOnce you fail to meet expectations, it is very difficult to regain\\ncredibility. At McKinsey, it is said that you are only as good as\\nyour last study. If you have one “bad” engagement, all your hard', 'teams. You won’t be staffed on the interesting projects. You won’t\\nbe put in a position to excel. Your career at the Firm will suffer.\\nPrepare your résumé.\\n\\nThe same thing happens in the stock market. A high-flying\\ncompany that posts 20 percent profit increases every year sees its\\nstock price soar. When it misses one quarter, even by as little as a\\ncent, its momentum reverses. Wall Street drops the stock like a hot\\npotato and its share price plummets. After that, even when the\\ncompany gets back on the growth track, several years can go by\\nbefore investors trust it enough to pile back in. \\n\\nWhen I was a kid, I had a fantasy baseball board game. You\\npicked your team from a combination of then current players (Carl\\nYastrzemski, Sandy Koufax, Roberto Clemente) and baseball leg-\\nends (Ruth, Cobb, DiMaggio). Each player came on a circle of\\n\\n\\x0c80/20 and Other Rules to Live By\\n\\n41\\n\\npaper marked out in sections printed with a result: single, double,\\nhome  run,  strikeout,  and  so  forth.  The  size  of  each  section', 'put the circle around a little pointer and spin the pointer; wherever\\nit landed was the result for that player’s turn at bat. The one thing\\nI remember from that game was that the home run kings like Ruth,\\nDiMaggio, and Aaron had the biggest strikeout zones too.\\n\\nIt’s all very well to talk of the necessity to strive purposefully\\nand, if you fail, to fail gloriously. It’s OK for Mark McGwire to\\nstrike out a lot, as long as he keeps hitting those home runs. In the\\nbusiness world, though, you’re much better off hitting singles.\\n\\nLOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE\\nEvery now and then, take a mental step back from whatever\\nyou’re doing. Ask yourself some basic questions: How does\\nwhat you’re doing solve the problem? How does it advance\\nyour thinking? Is it the most important thing you could be\\ndoing right now? If it’s not helping, why are you doing it?\\n\\nWhen you are trying to solve a difficult problem for your client or\\ncompany, you can easily lose sight of your goal amid the million\\nand one demands on your time. It’s like you are hip-deep in a bog,\\nfollowing a muddy channel that you can’t see. Analysis B follows', 'C. New data comes in and points to yet more analyses with which\\nto fill your days (and nights).\\n\\nWhen you’re feeling swamped by it all, take a metaphorical\\nstep back and figure out what it is you’re trying to achieve. Do\\n\\n\\x0c42\\n\\nThinking About Business Problems\\n\\nthis by looking at “the big picture”: the set of issues that make up\\nyour operating hypothesis. How does what you’re doing fit into\\nthe big picture? A particular analysis may be intellectually correct,\\neven interesting, but if it doesn’t take you closer to a solution, it’s\\na waste of time. Figure out your priorities; you can do only  so\\nmuch in a day. There is nothing quite so frustrating as looking\\nback over the course of a day or week and realizing, not that you\\nhaven’t come up with any end products, but that what you have\\ncome up with is worthless in terms of the problem at hand.\\n\\nAs one former McKinsey EM told me, “Perhaps the most valu-\\nable thing I learned during my time at the Firm was to think about\\nthe big picture—to take a step back, figure out what I’m trying to\\nachieve,  and  then  look  at  whatever  I’m  doing  and  ask  myself,', '\\nJUST SAY, “I DON’T KNOW”\\nThe Firm pounds the concept of professional integrity into its\\nassociates from their first day on the job, and rightly so. One\\nimportant aspect of professional integrity is honesty—with\\nyour  clients,  your  team  members,  and  yourself.  Honesty\\nincludes recognizing when you haven’t got a clue. Admitting\\nthat is a lot less costly than bluffing.\\n\\nIt was the morning of an important progress meeting at our client,\\na Fortune 50 manufacturing company. The team and John, our\\nED,* were going over the various sections of the presentation. I\\n\\n*Engagement director, also called a partner. The ED is in charge of a study, and most EDs\\nhead up several studies at one time. EDs have an equity stake in the Firm.\\n\\n\\x0c80/20 and Other Rules to Live By\\n\\n43\\n\\nhad already been through my piece of it; I had been up until 4 a.m.\\ngetting it ready and I was exhausted. As the discussion moved to\\nanother section, one that I had nothing to do with and knew little\\nabout, my brain started slipping into that blissful place known as\\nsleep. I could hear the other members of the team discussing vari-', 'through a child’s cupped fingers. \\n\\nSuddenly, my reverie evaporated as John asked me, “So, Ethan,\\nwhat do you think about Suzie’s point?” Momentary shock and\\nfear yielded to concentration as I tried to recall what had just been\\nsaid. Years of Ivy League and business school reflexes took over\\nand I came out with a few lines of general agreement. Of course,\\nwhat I said might just as well have come out of a horse’s backside. \\nIf I had told John, “I’m not really sure—I haven’t looked at this\\nissue before,” I would have been fine. Even if I had said, “Sorry, I\\njust lost it for a minute,” he would have understood; after all, he\\nhad been through exactly the same experience, like every other\\nMcKinsey-ite. Instead, I tried to fake it, and ended up slipping in\\nmy own horsefeathers.\\n\\nAt the end of the engagement, several weeks later, the team had\\nits final party. We went out to TGI Friday’s, ate a lot of nachos,\\nand drank a lot of beer. Then the EM began presenting each of the\\nteam members with presents of a rude and/or humorous nature.', 'following words, neatly printed in the McKinsey official font: “Just\\nsay, ‘I don’t know.’”\\n\\nThis is sage advice, and that picture frame remains on my desk\\n\\nto this day. \\n\\n\\x0c44\\n\\nThinking About Business Problems\\n\\nDON’T ACCEPT “I HAVE NO IDEA”\\nPeople always have an idea if you probe just a bit.

Like the\\nsculptor who turned a block of marble into an elephant by chisel-\\ning away everything that didn’t look like an elephant, you must\\nchip away at “I have no idea” with pointed questions.', 'When Jason Klein wanted to put together a new business unit,\\nhe was sure that his top competitor was outspending him by a factor\\nof 10. How could he prove this to his board of directors so they\\nwould give him more funding? He told his team to put together a\\nP&L (profit and loss statement) for the competitor that showed what\\nit was spending. As he recalls it:\\n\\nWhen I first suggested that we do this analysis, my people\\nsaid, “We have no idea.” So I challenged them. Did they\\nknow how much our competitor was spending on advertis-\\ning? No, but they could make an educated guess. Did they\\nknow how much our competitor was spending on produc-\\ntion costs? No, but they could make an estimate of the com-\\npetitor’s  cost  per  issue  and  multiply  that  by  reported\\ncirculation. And so it went.\\n\\n\\x0c80/20 and Other Rules to Live By\\n\\n45\\n\\nIn the end, we put together a pretty comprehensive P&L\\nbacked up by solid assumptions.

They go unnoticed until\\nthey start nibbling your cheese. Just building a better mouse-\\ntrap will not make the world beat a path to your door. Peo-\\nple who don’t have mice won’t be interested—until the mice\\nshow up; then they need to know you have the mousetrap.\\nThis might sound like the musings of a Zen monk (or per-\\nhaps a management consultant from California). But some-\\ntimes the right way to sell your product or service is not to\\nbarge into your customer’s home with a bunch of free sam-\\nples. Just be there, at the right time, and make sure the right\\npeople know who you are.\\n\\nAt around 10 one evening, I went up to the office of Dominic, the\\npartner on my team, to drop off some documents that I knew he\\nwanted to see in the morning. To my surprise, he was still at his', '“beauty parade” for a prospective client the next morning. \\n\\n“Good luck,” I told him as I left. “I hope you sell them on\\n\\nthis one.”\\n\\n“No, no,” he replied. “Remember, McKinsey doesn’t sell.”\\nThis dictum may sound strange. How could a company grow\\nto the size of McKinsey without selling? But it is true. This curi-\\nous aspect of McKinsey’s culture stems from the roots of the Firm’s\\nfounders in “white shoe” law and accounting firms before World\\nWar II. In those days, it was considered beneath the dignity of pro-\\nfessional service firms to advertise or solicit business.\\n\\nTimes may have changed, but the no-selling legacy persists at\\nMcKinsey because it works very well in the consulting business.\\n\\n\\x0cSelling a Study\\n\\n51\\n\\nNo senior McKinsey directors make cold calls at the offices of Bill\\nGates  and  Ted  Turner  asking  if  they  have  problems  they  want\\nsolved. The Firm does not run ads in Forbes or Barron’s advertis-\\ning  50  percent  off  telecommunications  consulting.  Although  a\\npartner’s compensation depends in large part on the amount of\\nbusiness he brings to the Firm, no one goes out to knock on doors.', '\\nAnd  ring  it  does,  not  because  McKinsey  sells,  but  because\\nMcKinsey markets. It does this in several different ways, all of\\nthem designed to make sure that on the day a senior executive\\ndecides she has a business problem, one of the first calls she makes\\nis to the local office of McKinsey. The Firm produces a steady\\nstream of books and articles, some of them extremely influential,\\nsuch as the famous In Search of Excellence by Peters and Water-\\nman.* McKinsey also publishes its own scholarly journal, The\\nMcKinsey Quarterly, which it sends gratis to its clients, as well as\\nto its former consultants, many of whom now occupy senior posi-\\ntions at potential clients. The Firm invites (and gets) a lot of cov-\\nerage by journalists. Many McKinsey partners and directors are\\ninternationally known as experts in their fields. Examples are Low-\\nell Bryan, who has advised congressional banking committees, and\\nKenichi Ohmae (who recently left the Firm), the business guru\\nwhose nickname in Japanese is “Keiei no Kamisama”—the God\\nof Management.\\n\\nMcKinsey maintains a vast network of informal contacts with\\npotential clients as well. The Firm encourages its partners to par-', 'boards of charities, museums, and cultural organizations; many\\nmembers of these boards are executives at current or potential\\nclients. McKinsey consultants also address industry conferences.\\n\\n*Thomas J. Peters and Robert H. Waterman, Jr., In Search of Excellence: Lessons from\\nAmerica’s Best-Run Companies (New York: Harper&Row, 1982).\\n\\n\\x0c52\\n\\nWorking to Solve Business Problems\\n\\nOccasional meetings with former clients allow partners not only\\nto check up on the effects of past McKinsey projects, but to make\\nsure that the Firm maintains some “share of mind” should new\\nproblems arise at the client.\\n\\nThese efforts could not be construed as selling, but they make\\nsure that the right people know the Firm is there. That keeps the\\nphones ringing.\\n\\nIf you’re in sales, then you probably do have to make the cold\\ncalls. For some people that is the fun of selling. But even the best\\nfoot-in-the-door saleswoman needs to market. \\n\\nYou may not be on the same charitable board as billionaire\\ninvestor Warren Buffett, but you can still find ways to network\\nwith existing and potential clients and customers. Trade shows,\\nand conferences, even the right bars, will give you the chance to\\nmake sure they know who you are. Does your particular field have', 'industry insiders: Write a good article and you will get your name\\nin front of people who would otherwise never have heard of you.\\nMeet your competitors too. Today’s competitor could change jobs\\nand become tomorrow’s customer. Make sure he knows you! It all\\nadds up to making sure your name is the one your customers think\\nof when they have a need you can fill. \\n\\n\\x0cSelling a Study\\n\\n53\\n\\nBE CAREFUL WHAT YOU PROMISE:\\nSTRUCTURING AN ENGAGEMENT\\nWhen structuring your project, whether you are selling your\\nservices as a consultant or have been picked by your organi-\\nzation to solve an internal problem, don’t bite off more than\\nyou can chew. Set definite milestones that you can meet. That\\nway, you’ll have targets you can achieve and your client will\\nbe satisfied.\\n\\nWhen clients come to McKinsey with a problem, they want it fixed\\nyesterday and for nothing. Fortunately, most clients realize that\\nthis desire is just slightly unrealistic. Still, when structuring an\\nengagement, McKinsey (usually in the person of a DCS* or ED)\\nfaces a lot of pressure to deliver the maximum results in the mini-\\nmum time. McKinsey bills by the hour, and those hours do not', '\\nThe ED (or whoever is structuring the engagement) stands\\nbetween the client and its demands on one side, and the engage-\\nment team on the other. The team can be pushed only so far for so\\nlong before the quality of its work begins to decline. McKinsey\\nconsultants, in general, work very hard over the course of a study,\\nbut they do have limits; they also have lives, which they would\\nlike, at least occasionally, to live. The challenge for the ED is to\\nbalance the desires and budget constraints of the client with the\\nlimits  of  the  team.  The  ideal  synthesis  of  these  two  opposing\\nforces is a project that a team of four to six consultants can com-\\n\\n*Director of client services, a.k.a. director. The DCS is in charge of the overall relationship\\nwith a client. Directors have a larger stake in the Firm than mere partners. The DCS is the\\nhighest rung of the McKinsey hierarchy.\\n\\n\\x0c54\\n\\nWorking to Solve Business Problems\\n\\nplete in three to six months and that will produce tangible results\\nfor the client. \\n\\nAs the Firm spends time within a client organization, it almost\\nalways uncovers new problems that could benefit from McKinsey’s', 'time and in another engagement. Consequently, McKinsey engage-\\nments  tend  to  generate  new  business  of  their  own  accord. \\nThus,  as  long  as  the  client  is  happy  with  the  results  that  the \\nFirm produces, McKinsey is likely to have a stream of new business\\n(for which it often will not need to compete).\\n\\nAs an organization, McKinsey is extremely good at figuring\\nout how much a team can do over the length of a typical study. The\\nbest EDs can balance the competing demands of client and team to\\na nicety; they tell the client, “We’re going to do X and Y. We could\\ndo Z, but it would kill the team,” while telling the team, “Look,\\nwe’ve already promised the client that we would do Z, so we’ve\\ngot to deliver.” They then work the team to its limit while simul-\\ntaneously making the client feel that he is getting value for money\\nand exceeding his expectations. \\n\\nOf course, not every ED is that good. In my time at the Firm,\\ncertain EDs had reputations for overpromising to the client and\\nthen putting their teams through hell. They were to be avoided,', 'product of a study and left the team to figure out just what it was\\nsupposed to do.\\n\\nWhat lessons does the McKinsey experience give for the way\\nyou should structure your problem-solving project? If you are a\\nconsultant putting together a proposal for an outside client, then\\nthe answer is simple: Don’t bite off more than you (and your team)\\ncan chew and know what your end product is going to be. \\n\\nIf your boss steps into your office and says, “We have a little\\nproblem and we want you to head up a team to solve it,” then the\\n\\n\\x0cSelling a Study\\n\\n55\\n\\nlesson for you is a bit more complicated. Don’t blithely accept the\\nassignment and say, “Sure, boss.” If you do, you could be setting\\nyourself up for a fall.\\n\\nBefore you go hot footing it in search of a solution, get a feel\\nfor the scope of the problem. Is it something you and your team\\ncan solve in the time allotted? If not, either get more time or, even\\nbetter, sit down with your boss and break the problem down into\\nbite-size chunks. Figure out what the end product of each chunk\\nwill be: a recommendation, an implementation plan, a new prod-', 'reach your goal and get a commitment from your boss that you\\nwill have them. Doing all this ahead of time can save you a lot of\\ngrief a few months down the road.\\n\\nStructuring your project properly at the beginning may not\\nguarantee your success, but it at least gets you off to the right start.\\n\\n\\x0cThis page intentionally left blank.\\n\\n\\x0c5\\n\\nASSEMBLING A TEAM\\n\\nABOUT TEAMS AT MCKINSEY\\n\\nAt McKinsey, you never walk alone—or, at least, you never\\nwork alone. Everything at the Firm happens in teams, from\\nfront-line work on client engagements all the way up to\\nfirmwide  decision  making.  The  smallest  team  I  ever\\nworked  on  consisted  of  me  and  my  EM  on  a  pro  bono\\nengagement for a New York theater company. At the other\\nend of the scale, the Firm’s largest clients might have sev-\\neral five- or six-person teams working on site at one time;\\ntogether,  these  form  a  “metateam.”  In  the  early  1990s,\\nmembers of the AT&T metateam decided to get together to', 'room large enough to hold them all, so they had to book\\na New Jersey hotel.\\n\\nMcKinsey relies on teams because they are the best way\\nto solve the problems that the Firm’s clients face. The com-\\nplexity of these problems makes it impossible for one per-\\nson to solve them—at least to the Firm’s high standards.\\nMore people mean more hands to gather and analyze data\\nand, more important, more minds to figure out what the\\ndata really mean. If you face complex problems in your\\nbusiness, you should probably put together a team to help\\nsolve them too. In the face of complexity, many hands don’t\\njust make light work; they make for a better result.\\n\\nCopyright 1999 Ethan M. Rasiel.  Click here for Terms of Use.\\n\\n57\\n\\n\\x0c58\\n\\nWorking to Solve Business Problems\\n\\nThe Firm has developed a number of strategies for putting\\ntogether and maintaining high-performance teams. In this\\nchapter, you will learn how to select the right people for your\\nteam. You will also discover some tricks for keeping your\\nteam happy and productive under pressure.\\n\\n\\x0cAssembling a Team\\n\\n59\\n\\nGETTING THE MIX RIGHT\\nYou can’t just throw four random people at a problem and', 'personalities will work best for your project. Then choose\\nyour teammates carefully. \\n\\nTo succeed as a business problem solver, you must choose your\\nteam carefully, getting the best mix of people from the resources\\nyou have available. McKinsey benefits from a global pool of tal-\\nented, intelligent individuals whose strengths and weaknesses the\\nFirm tracks closely. Even with this advantage, EMs and EDs must\\nlearn the art of team selection. Their experiences can help you,\\neven if you can’t call on the same level of resources.\\n\\nMcKinsey-ites subscribe to one of two theories of team selec-\\ntion. The first theory states that intellectual horsepower is every-\\nthing—find the smartest people for your team regardless of their\\nexperience or personal hygiene. The second theory says that what\\nreally matters is specific experience and skills; intelligence is a\\ngiven within the Firm—every McKinsey consultant is smart or he\\nwouldn’t be there.\\n\\nNeither of these theories is completely correct, but neither of\\nthem is completely wrong either. Proper team selection varies from\\nproblem to problem and client to client. Some problems will yield\\nonly to large amounts of analytical firepower. For instance, if you\\nhave mountains of complex data that you need to decipher, then', 'find, regardless of whether they can simultaneously walk and chew\\ngum. On the other hand, if you are managing a big reorganization\\nduring which many sensitive decisions will have to be made, you\\n\\n\\x0c60\\n\\nWorking to Solve Business Problems\\n\\nwould prefer to have someone on your team with good people\\nskills and experience in implementing change.\\n\\nAnother  important  team  selection  lesson  emerges  from  the\\nMcKinsey team assignment process. When an engagement begins,\\nthe EM and ED pick their associates from the pool of available\\nresources at the time. The “manager of associate development” or\\nthe office manager will tell them who is available and give them a\\nsheet listing each associate’s experience and rating each one on\\nanalytical  ability,  client  management  skills,  and  so  forth.  The\\nbiggest mistake in team selection comes from taking those ratings\\nat face value. A smart EM always talks to potential team members\\nbefore taking them on. \\n\\nBy extension, if you are in a position to pick your team mem-\\nbers before embarking on a project, never just accept people who\\nare supposed to be good. Meet them face to face. Talk to them;\\nsee what’s behind the recommendations. Maybe in her last assign-', 'his last boss was scared to tell the truth about him. (Of course, if\\nhe  is  the  CEO’s  nephew,  you  may  be  stuck  with  him.)  Maybe\\nCarol’s brilliant, but after spending 15 minutes talking to her, you\\nknow she would drive you crazy if she were on your team. \\n\\nJust remember, if you are lucky enough to be able to choose\\n\\nwhom you will work with, choose wisely. \\n\\n\\x0cAssembling a Team\\n\\n61\\n\\nA LITTLE TEAM BONDING GOES A LONG WAY\\nIt’s a truism that a team will perform better and its members\\nwill have a better time if the team members get along well. As\\na team leader, you should make an effort to promote team\\nbonding; just make sure it doesn’t become a chore.\\n\\nFor  McKinsey-ites,  team-bonding  activities  are  a  given.  In  the\\ncourse of an engagement, you expect to go out at least a few times\\nto the nicest restaurants in town, or to see a show or a game on\\nMcKinsey’s (and, eventually, the client’s) nickel. One ED even took', '\\nAs a team leader, the question for you is how much formal\\nteam bonding is enough. After talking with a number of former\\nMcKinsey-ites, and reflecting on my own experience, I’m going to\\ngo out on a limb and say that the answer is not much. A little team\\nbonding goes a long way. As a team leader, you have the far more\\nimportant job of looking after team morale (see the next section).\\nFormer SEM Abe Bleiberg put it like this:\\n\\nI’m not sure that team bonding is all that important. What’s\\nimportant is that a team works together well, and that will\\ncome or not over the course of a project. It’s also important\\nthat individuals feel respected and that they feel that their\\nideas are respected. \\n\\nTeam  bonding  is  not,  “Did  you  take  your  team  to\\nenough dinners? Did you go out to the movies? Did you go\\nto the circus?” Most people, even very hard-working people,\\nwant to have a life, to be with their families. I think that’s\\nmore important than going out to the circus.\\n\\n\\x0c62\\n\\nWorking to Solve Business Problems\\n\\nIf a team is going to bond, it will mostly bond through work.', 'day, plus a day over the weekend at the office. That’s plenty of\\ntime for bonding. Also, on an out-of-town study, team members\\nwill  eat  dinner  together  more  often  than  not.  Why,  as  a  team\\nleader, would you want to take up yet more of their time? If the\\nteam isn’t bonding, how is a fancy dinner going to help? Will it\\nmake a bad work experience good?\\n\\nSo, when managing your team, be selective with team-bond-\\ning  activities.  Try  to  get  your  team’s  “significant  others”\\ninvolved; this will help them understand what their loved ones—\\nyour teammates—are doing, and it will help you understand\\nyour teammates. Above all, respect your teammates’ time. One\\nformer associate noted that, at McKinsey, the best team dinners\\nwere at lunch —they showed that the EM knew the associates\\nhad lives.\\n\\nTAKE YOUR TEAM’S TEMPERATURE TO \\nMAINTAIN MORALE\\nMaintaining your team’s morale is an on-going responsibility.\\nIf you don’t do it, your team will not perform well. Make\\nsure you know how your team feels.\\n\\nIn my time at McKinsey, I worked on two studies that didn’t turn', 'McKinsey team became a football kicked between rival factions\\nat the client. After one of the studies, I recognized that we hadn’t\\nsucceeded and I was ready to move on to the next engagement.\\n\\n\\x0cAssembling a Team\\n\\n63\\n\\nAfter the other, I was ready to leave the Firm.* Why the different\\nreactions? Team morale.\\n\\nMy “bad” EM (who shall remain nameless) managed by the\\nMushroom Method: “Cover them with manure and keep them in\\nthe dark.” We associates never felt that we knew what was going\\non; I never got a sense that what I was doing was valuable, either\\nto the team or to the client. My “good” EM, on the other hand,\\nalways let us know what was going on, and if he didn’t know, Vik\\ntold us so. We knew about the client politics—we understood it—\\nand that made it easier for us to work with it. Also, I knew that\\nVik’s door was always open and that he was pulling for us as much\\nas for the client.**\\n\\nWhat’s  the  secret  to  maintaining  team  morale?  There  isn’t\\n\\none—just a few simple rules to remember.', 'Take your team’s temperature. Talk to your teammates. Make\\nsure they are happy with what they are doing. Find out if they have\\nquestions about what they are doing or why they are doing it, and\\nanswer them. If they are unhappy, take remedial action quickly.\\n\\nSteer a steady course. If you change your mind all the time\\nabout the team’s priorities or the analyses you’re doing, your team\\nwill  quickly  become  confused  and  demoralized.  Know  where\\nyou’re going and stay your course. If you need an extra day to fig-\\nure it out, take it. If you need to make a big change, let your team\\nknow, explain why, and let people contribute to, or at least see,\\nyour thought process.\\n\\nLet your teammates know why they are doing what they’re\\ndoing. People want to feel that what they are doing is adding value\\nto the client. There are few things more demoralizing than doing\\nsomething that you and your team leader know is valueless. No\\n\\n*I didn’t. I went skiing in Vail for a week instead. I felt better after that.\\n**Both EMs eventually made partner—a comment, perhaps, on which skills the Firm val-', '\\n\\x0c64\\n\\nWorking to Solve Business Problems\\n\\none on your team should ever feel, “I’ve just spent two weeks of\\nmy life for nothing.”\\n\\nTreat your teammates with respect. There is no excuse for\\ntreating  people  with  disrespect;  it’s  completely  unprofessional.\\nRespect doesn’t just mean politeness. It means remembering that\\nyour teammates may have different priorities than you do, and that\\nthey may have lives outside of work. You may like to work until\\nmidnight six days a week, but your team may have better things\\nto do. There will be times, of course, when the team must work\\nall hours, but be sure it really is one of those times before you call\\na team meeting at 10 p.m. Respect also means never asking some-\\none to do something you wouldn’t do or haven’t done yourself. As\\nan associate, I always felt a bit better knowing that if I was in the\\noffice at midnight, my EM was too.\\n\\nGet to know your teammates as people. Are they married? Do\\nthey have kids? What are their hobbies? It will help you to under-\\nstand them. Share a bit about yourself as well; that makes it more', 'than  “them.”  This,  incidentally,  is  a  much  better  way  of  team\\nbonding than taking your team out to the ball game.\\n\\nWhen the going gets tough, take the Bill Clinton approach.\\nSometimes, as in my two bad experiences, you will be dealt a bad\\nhand. The problem is difficult; the client is difficult. There’s not a\\nlot you can do beyond telling your team, “I feel your pain.” At\\nsome point, you have to soldier on; that’s life. \\n\\nSpending months solving complex business problems is no bed\\nof roses. If you follow the rules on maintaining morale, however, at\\nleast your team won’t feel like resigning when it’s all over.\\n\\n\\x0c6\\n\\nMANAGING HIERARCHY\\n\\nABOUT THE MCKINSEY CHAIN \\nOF COMMAND\\n\\nMcKinsey has something of a split personality when it comes\\nto hierarchy. On the one hand, the Firm claims that it has no\\nreal hierarchy. On the other hand, any McKinsey-ite past or\\npresent can tell you that two hierarchies (at least) exist within\\nMcKinsey. Both statements are correct.\\n\\nI cannot imagine a flatter organization than McKinsey. I', 'appointment and talk to him about our study. In meetings at\\nthe Firm, every idea, whether it comes from the youngest\\nbusiness  analyst  or  the  oldest  director,  carries  the  same\\nweight  and  is  debated  and  attacked  accordingly  (at  least\\nthat’s the way it’s supposed to be, and usually is).\\n\\nAt the same time, McKinsey has a definite chain of com-\\nmand. The directors and, to a lesser extent, the partners\\nmake  decisions  about  the  direction  of  the  Firm,  and  the\\nEMs, associates, analysts, and support staff live with them.\\nIf  I  disagreed  with  my  EM  over  an  issue,  at  the  end  of \\nthe day, his opinion won out. Likewise, my ED’s opinion\\ntrumped my EM’s.\\n\\nThen, McKinsey has another, unofficial hierarchy: one\\nbased on experience and credentials—how good you are (or\\nare  perceived  to  be).  At  each  level,  certain  people  were\\nknown to be “stars.” Stellar associates could pick and choose\\n\\nCopyright 1999 Ethan M. Rasiel.

On  the  other  hand,\\nassociates who performed poorly didn’t last very long at the\\nFirm—after one bad engagement, no EM or ED would want\\nthem on the team. Likewise, the associates generally knew\\nwhich EMs to avoid and which EDs had missed the Firm’s\\nfast track.\\n\\nEvery organization has its own approach to hierarchy.\\nYour own may look nothing at all like the Firm’s. Still, every\\nMcKinsey-ite has learned a few lessons about dealing with\\nhierarchy that should work in any organization. They can\\nhelp you stay out of trouble and get ahead.\\n\\n\\x0cManaging Hierarchy\\n\\n67\\n\\nMAKE YOUR BOSS LOOK GOOD\\nIf you make your boss look good, your boss will make you\\nlook good. That’s the quid pro quo of hierarchy.\\n\\nI was a first-year associate and I’d just spent several weeks putting\\ntogether a comprehensive competitor analysis for my client. When\\nit came time to share my findings with the senior management of', 'make the presentation. My EM got the job instead. I was disap-\\npointed, but I understood the rationale behind the decision.\\n\\nIt then became my job, over the course of several hours, to\\nmake my EM as conversant with my analysis as I was. The next\\nday, he delivered the presentation very convincingly. When the\\nclient asked questions, my EM answered them; all the while, I was\\nwriting him notes, whispering facts in his ear, and pointing out\\nimportant pages in the presentation document. The client was suit-\\nably impressed with the presentation and with my EM. My EM\\n(my boss) and my ED (my boss’s boss) were impressed with me. I\\nhad done my job and the Firm would know about it.\\n\\nIn any hierarchical organization, the most important person\\nin your world, day in and day out, is your boss. When you work in\\nteams, away from the main office, in a distant city or foreign coun-\\ntry, that importance increases by an order of magnitude. Your boss\\nmay be the only person in your organization who can see you.\\nYou’d better make her happy.

Keep  on  doing  it  until  someone  tells  you \\notherwise. Obviously, this is not a strategy for everyone.\\n\\nHamish McDermott, a newly hired associate fresh from a graduate\\ndegree in philosophy at Cambridge, found himself assigned to an\\ninternal research project—what McKinsey calls practice develop-\\nment, or PD—for Lowell Bryan, a director of the Firm and a very', 'a book on bank failures and asked Hamish and the rest of the team\\nfor their comments. Hamish took Lowell at his word and pro-\\nceeded to write an account of all the logical flaws in the chapter. As\\nHamish remembers it:\\n\\nThere I was, after a week at the Firm, showing the head of\\nthe finance practice exactly where he was being logically\\n\\n\\x0cManaging Hierarchy\\n\\n69\\n\\ninconsistent  and  where  his  arguments  were  failing.  Of\\ncourse, I had used a very dry, superior tone, as if it were\\nan exam question at Cambridge: “So-and-so has made a\\nvaliant  effort  to  expound  his  thesis,  but  failed  for  the \\nfollowing 16 reasons.”\\n\\nLowell  was  working  out  of  town  at  the  time,  and  Hamish\\nfaxed his comments directly to him, without showing them to his\\nEM. In many firms, this would have been enough to get Hamish\\nthe sack, but Lowell was fine with it. Hamish’s EM later com-\\nmented that maybe he should have been more careful about the\\ntone of his comments. In fact, when the book came out, Lowell', 'your help, especially with Chapter 2.” Hamish went on to have a\\nvery successful career at the Firm.\\n\\nThis story shows that, in a meritocratic organization at least,\\nyou can assert your equality until shown otherwise—until someone\\ntells you, “No, you have to do what I tell you.” You’ll find it’s rare\\nfor that to happen. As Hamish said:\\n\\nIt sounds extreme, but in a way, to be a successful consul-\\ntant, you have to assert yourself. Very often, you’ll be in a sit-\\nuation  where  you  just  have  to  assume  that  you  can  do\\nsomething, or talk to someone, or get access to some bit of\\ninformation, even though you may not have the explicit\\nauthority to do so.\\n\\nThis is a risky strategy, and the more hierarchical an organiza-\\ntion, the riskier it becomes. In a more rigid organization, be more\\nsensitive of where the limits to others’ authority lie.

They gave me, along with structured answers to my\\nspecific questions, a number of tips and tricks to succeed in the var-\\nious aspects of life at McKinsey. Here is a grab bag of tips to make\\nyour research more efficient and effective.\\n\\nStart with the annual report. If you want to get up to speed\\non a company as quickly as possible, the first place to turn is the\\nannual report. It’s easy to obtain (many companies now post their\\nannuals on the World Wide Web) and contains a great deal of', '\\nWhen you get a company’s annual, turn first to the “Message\\nto Shareholders” or “Chairman’s Remarks” at the front. If you\\nread the section carefully, and a little skeptically, you’ll find out a\\nlot about how the company has performed in the last year, where\\n\\n\\x0cDoing Research\\n\\n75\\n\\nmanagement hopes to take the company in the future, and the\\nstrategy for getting there. You’ll usually also get a quick break-\\ndown of key financial indicators such as stock price, revenue, and\\nearnings per share. Go further into the annual, and you’ll find out\\nabout the company’s business units and product lines, who its\\nsenior managers are, and where the company has offices and pro-\\nduction facilities. Then you can plough into the numbers. \\n\\nA company’s annual report will get your research off to a\\n\\nrapid start. \\n\\nLook for outliers. When you’ve collected a large amount of\\ndata on a particular aspect of your problem, look for outliers—\\nthings that are especially good or bad. Use a computer to get a\\nquick picture.\\n\\nFor example, suppose you are collecting data on your com-\\npany’s sales force. Enter the average sales of each salesperson and', 'say,  the  last  three  years;  this  gives  you  the  average  sales  per\\naccount. Type the data into your favorite spreadsheet software and\\nsort the averages from lowest to highest. Then look at the two or\\nthree best and worst figures. Congratulations, you’ve just found a\\nfruitful area for research. Figure out why the numbers are so good\\nor bad and you’ll be well on your way to fixing the problem. \\n\\nLook for best practice. There’s an old saying that no matter\\nhow good you are at something, there’s always somebody better.\\nThis is as true in business as it is anywhere else. Find out what the\\nbest performers in the industry are doing and imitate them. Often,\\nthis is the quickest antidote to poor performance.\\n\\nUsually, you can’t find out about best practice in the library.\\nYou have to think creatively. If some of your competitors have best\\npractice, they probably won’t tell you their secrets. Talk to other\\npeople in the industry: suppliers, customers, Wall Street analysts,\\nfriends from business school, and so forth.\\n\\n\\x0c76\\n\\nWorking to Solve Business Problems\\n\\nSometimes you can find best practice within your company.\\nSomeone, some team, or some division is outperforming the rest of', 'performer’s secrets throughout your organization. The result will\\nbe a huge payoff to your business.\\n\\n\\x0c8\\n\\nCONDUCTING INTERVIEWS\\n\\nABOUT INTERVIEWING AT MCKINSEY\\n\\nIn every McKinsey engagement, someone on the team will\\nconduct an interview. In most engagements, the team will\\nconduct  lots  of  them.  There  is  always  someone  who  has\\ninformation that the team needs: an executive at the client, \\na  production-line  supervisor,  a  supplier,  a  customer,  an\\nindustry expert, even a competitor. Interviewing is the way\\nMcKinsey consultants fill the gaps in their knowledge base\\nand tap into the experience and knowledge of their clients.\\nInterviewing is such an important part of the McKinsey\\nproblem-solving process that it merits its own chapter in this\\nbook, separate from research. You can learn a lot from read-\\ning magazine articles, books, and scholarly papers, but to\\nget the nitty-gritty on an organization, you have to ask ques-\\ntions of and get answers from the people on the front line.\\nInterviewing is a skill in its own right, and most people have\\nno idea how to go about it.', 'You might think that even though interviewing McKinsey-\\nstyle is a good technique for consultants who need to get up\\nto speed on unfamiliar industries, it is of little use to execu-\\ntives in more settled positions.

You may have\\nonly  30  minutes  with  a  person  whom  you  may  never  see\\nagain. Know what you’re going to ask.\\n\\nWhen I asked McKinsey alumni for their best advice on inter-\\nviews, every single one of them said, “Write an interview guide.”\\nMany people resent being interviewed, or at least begrudge you\\nthe time that you are taking from their day. A guide is your best\\ntool for getting what you want from interviewees and for mak-\\ning the best use of your time—and theirs. \\n\\nYou must think on two levels when constructing your guide.\\nFirst, and obviously, what are the questions to which you need\\nanswers? Write them all down in any order. Second, and more\\nimportant, what do you really need from this interview? What\\nare you trying to achieve? Why are you talking to this person?\\nDefining your purpose will help you put your questions in the\\nright order and phrase them correctly. \\n\\nIt helps to know as much as possible about the interviewee', 'if you ask a sensitive question? Or is she a middle-level manager\\nwhose pleas for change in her organization have gone unheeded?\\nBoth  might  know  the  same  piece  of  information,  but  you’d\\napproach each one differently.\\n\\nAt McKinsey we were taught that, as a rule, an interview\\nshould start with general questions and move on to specific ones.\\nDon’t dive right into a sensitive area like “What are your respon-\\nsibilities?” or “How long have you been with the company?”\\nStart with anodyne questions about, say, the industry overall.\\n\\n\\x0c80\\n\\nWorking to Solve Business Problems\\n\\nThis  will  help  the  interviewee  “warm  up”  and  allow  you  to\\ndevelop rapport.\\n\\nWhen deciding on which questions to ask, you might want to\\ninclude  some  to  which  you  know  the  answer.  This  may  sound\\ncounterintuitive, but it’s really very useful. On questions of fact,\\nasking a “ringer” will give you some insights into the interviewee’s\\nhonesty and/or knowledge. For complex issues, you may think you\\n“know” the answer, but there may be more than one; you should', '\\nOnce you’ve written your guide, look at it and ask yourself,\\n“What are the three things I most want to know by the end of the\\ninterview?” These are the things you will focus on when you go\\ninto the interviewee’s office, the three things that you will try your\\nhardest to obtain before you leave. Sometimes you won’t even get\\nthose answers (see “Difficult Interviews” later in the chapter), and\\nsometimes they’ll come easily. Anything more is gravy.\\n\\nFinally, every interview guide should conclude with what I call\\nthe prototypical McKinsey question. When you’ve asked all your\\nquestions, or you’re running out of time, put away your guide and\\nask the interviewee if there’s anything else he’d like to tell you or\\nany question you forgot to ask. As often as not, the interviewee\\nwill say no, but every once in a while you’ll strike paydirt. Remem-\\nber that, chances are, the people you interview know their organi-\\nzations, their business units, or their departments better than you\\ndo. They may know which problems are eluding senior managers,\\nwho’s pushing which agenda, or where the bones are buried. And\\nsometimes, if you’re lucky, they’ll tell you.', '\\x0cConducting Interviews\\n\\n81\\n\\nWHEN CONDUCTING INTERVIEWS, LISTEN\\nAND GUIDE\\nWhen you’re picking people’s brains, ask questions and then\\nlet them do the talking. Most people like to talk, especially\\nif you let them know you’re interested in what they’re saying.\\nKeep the interview on track by breaking in when necessary.\\n\\nMcKinsey consultants receive a lot of training in interviewing tech-\\nniques. The first thing we were taught was “always let the inter-\\nviewee know you are listening.” We did this by filling the gaps in\\nthe interviewee’s conversation with verbal placeholders such as\\n“yes, or “I see,” and even just “uh-huh” (this particular choice I\\nlike to call the McKinsey grunt*). Uh-huh may not seem like much,\\nbut it shows that you’re paying attention (even when you’re not!),\\nand it gives the other person a chance to gather his thoughts and\\ncatch his breath. \\n\\nWe also learned to communicate our interest through body lan-\\nguage. When the interviewee was speaking, we leaned toward her\\nslightly.  When  she  completed  a  sentence,  we  nodded.  And  we\\nalways took notes. Even if the interviewee was babbling (and this', 'wrote things down. Like the McKinsey grunt, note taking implied\\nwe were paying attention and kept us prepared in case the inter-\\nviewee did say something important.\\n\\nThis technique could be carried too far, of course. According\\nto one piece of Firm lore, two consultants went to interview a\\n\\n*I believe the McKinsey grunt has its origins in Japan. A conversation in Japanese is full of\\nverbal placeholders such as hai (yes), un (a less polite form of yes) and so desu ka (really?).\\nThe Japanese even have a word for this: aizuchi, which refers to two swordsmiths ham-\\nmering the same blade in turns.\\n\\n\\x0c82\\n\\nWorking to Solve Business Problems\\n\\nhigh-level executive at a client. The engagement manager made \\nhis  introduction,  then  started  asking  questions.  The  executive\\nanswered in detail. All through this, the associate nodded and\\ninterjected with “yes,” “uh-huh,” and “I see” while taking notes\\nat a furious pace, just as he had been taught, but he never asked\\nany questions himself. The EM asked follow-up questions and the\\nassociate just kept on nodding and saying “uh-huh.” When the\\ninterview ended, the EM thanked the executive for his time and', 'the executive pointed to the associate and asked the EM, “Does he\\nspeak English?”\\n\\nWhen McKinsey consultants conduct interviews, it’s because\\nthey want access to the information, experience, and anecdotes in\\nother person’s heads. Consultants are there to listen, not to talk.\\nThey  need  to  remember  that  the  other  person  has  a  separate\\nagenda, and needs to be kept on track. The process can sometimes\\nprove difficult. I once had to interview a purchasing manager from\\na client’s plant in Idaho. He knew all about the plant’s suppliers,\\ncustomers, input requirements, and manufacturing processes, but\\nall he cared about was fishing—fly fishing. “Did I fly fish?” he\\nwanted to know. I should try it. If I was ever in the Pocatello area,\\nhe could set me up. You get the picture. I felt a bit bad getting him\\noff his favorite subject, but I was there to get information, not\\nswap fish stories.\\n\\nThe main thing to remember when trying to get information\\nfrom  other  is  that  they  need  to  feel  you  are  listening  and  that\\nyou’re interested in what they have to say. Use positive body lan-', 'say more than they have, if you think they have left out something\\nimportant  but  you’re  not  sure  what  it  is,  say  nothing.  Let  the\\nsilence hang. Nature abhors a vacuum, and so do most people.\\nChances are they will start talking, just to fill the gap. If they have \\n\\n\\x0cConducting Interviews\\n\\n83\\n\\nbeen giving you a prepared “script,” they will probably drop it,\\nbecause the one thing they were not prepared for was silence. Try\\nit and see. It’s surprisingly effective.\\n\\nSEVEN TIPS FOR SUCCESSFUL INTERVIEWING\\nAlways think strategically when conducting an interview.\\nYou have a goal to reach and limited time to reach it. Here\\nare seven tried-and-tested stratagems to help you get what\\nyou want from an interviewee.\\n\\n1.  Have  the  interviewee’s  boss  set  up  the  meeting. Going\\nthrough the boss tells the interviewee that the interview is impor-\\ntant. He’ll be less likely to jerk you around if he knows his boss\\nwants him to talk to you.\\n\\n2. Interview in pairs. It’s very difficult to conduct an effective\\ninterview on your own. You may be so busy taking notes that it', 'verbal clues that the interviewee is giving. Sometimes, it is useful\\nfor a pair of interviewers to “tag-team”—switch roles from ques-\\ntion poser to note taker during the session. The approach is espe-\\ncially effective when one of the interviewers has specific knowledge\\non certain issues that will be covered. Furthermore, it is always\\nuseful to have two different views of what actually happened in the\\ninterview. Just make sure that whoever writes up the interview\\nnotes corroborates them with the other interviewer.\\n\\n3. Listen; don’t lead. In most interviews, you are not looking\\nfor  yes-or-no  answers  to  your  questions.  You  want  exhaustive\\nanswers—as much information as possible. The way to get them\\n\\n\\x0c84\\n\\nWorking to Solve Business Problems\\n\\nis to listen. Talk as little as possible, just enough to keep the inter-\\nview on track. Remember that the interviewee probably knows a\\nlot more about her business than you do, and most of the infor-\\nmation she gives you will be useful one way or another. \\n\\nHere’s another trick for keeping the information flowing. Ask\\nopen-ended  questions.  If  you  ask  yes-or-no  or  multiple-choice', 'find out when a store’s busiest season is. You think it is either sum-\\nmer or winter, but you’re not sure. If you ask the store manager, “Is\\nyour busiest season summer or winter?” she might say summer;\\nshe might say winter; or she might say, “Actually, it’s spring,” in\\nwhich case, you’ve just highlighted your lack of knowledge about\\nher business. If you ask her, “What is your busiest season?” she\\nwill give you the answer, and probably in more detail than if you\\ngave  her  multiple  choice—for  example,  “We’re  busiest  in  the\\nspring, specifically at Easter.” By asking the open-ended question,\\nyou get a much better result.\\n\\n4.  Paraphrase,  paraphrase,  paraphrase. Before  going  out  on\\ninterviews, every McKinsey consultant is trained to repeat back a sub-\\nject’s  answers  in  slightly  different  form.  I  cannot  overstress  how\\nimportant this is. Most people do not think or speak in a completely\\nstructured way. They ramble, they digress, they jumble important\\nfacts among irrelevancies. If you repeat their own words back to', 'whether you understood them correctly. Paraphrasing also gives the\\ninterviewee a chance to add information or amplify important points.\\n5. Use the indirect approach. An EM had on his team a new\\nassociate, fresh out of the Navy. The two had put together a very\\nclear interview guide and had agreed on a specific set of goals for\\nan interview with a middle-level manager at their client, so the EM\\nlet the associate take the lead. The associate proceeded to grill the\\nmanager aggressively in order to get precisely what he wanted, as\\n\\n\\x0cConducting Interviews\\n\\n85\\n\\nif it were an interrogation rather than an interview. As you might\\nimagine,  the  interviewee  was  rattled;  he  became  defensive  and\\nessentially refused to cooperate. \\n\\nThe moral of this tale is “Be sensitive to the interviewee’s feel-\\nings.” Understand that the person may feel threatened. Don’t dive\\nright into the tough questions. If you have to dance around the\\nimportant issues for a few minutes, that’s OK. Take time to make\\nthe interviewee comfortable with you and the interview process\\n(for an in-depth discussion, see the next section).\\n\\n6. Don’t ask for too much. There are two reasons not to ask', 'you write your interview guide, you narrow down your goals to\\nthe two or three most important questions. If you then ask the\\ninterviewee for the sum total of his knowledge of the widget indus-\\ntry, you may find yourself wading through a lot of information to\\nget what you really need, if you even find it at all.\\n\\nSecond, you want to stop short of the straw that breaks the\\ncamel’s back. Remember, being interviewed, especially in the con-\\ntext of a business problem, is an uncomfortable experience for\\nmany. If you compound that discomfort by pressing too hard, you\\nmay find that the interviewee becomes uncooperative or even hos-\\ntile. You never know when you may want to come back to this per-\\nson for more information, so don’t shut the door.\\n\\n7. Adopt the Columbo tactic. If you watched TV in the 1970s,\\nyou may remember Peter Falk’s trenchcoat wearing detective, Lieu-\\ntenant  Columbo.  After  he  finished  quizzing  a  murder  suspect\\nabout her whereabouts on the night in question, he would pick up\\nhis rumpled raincoat and head out the door. As he reached the\\nthreshold and was about to leave, he would turn around, stick his', 'something I forgot to ask.” This question invariably gave Columbo\\nthe answer he needed to figure out who did it.\\n\\n\\x0c86\\n\\nWorking to Solve Business Problems\\n\\nIf there’s a particular question you need the answer to, or a\\npiece of data that you want, the Columbo tactic is often a good\\nway to get it. Once the interview is over, everybody becomes more\\nrelaxed. The interviewee’s sense that you have some power over\\nhim will have disappeared. He is far less likely to be defensive, and\\nwill often tell you what you need or give you the information you\\nseek on the spot. Try it; it works.\\n\\nYou  might  also  want  to  try  the  “super-Columbo”  tactic.\\nInstead of turning around at the door, wait until a day or two has\\npassed, then drop by the interviewee’s office. You were just passing\\nby  and  remembered  a  question  you  forgot  to  ask.  Again,  this\\nmakes you much less threatening, and makes it more likely that\\nyou will get the information you need. \\n\\nDON’T LEAVE THE INTERVIEWEE NAKED\\nRemember that, for many people, being interviewed about', 'a responsibility to be sensitive to their fears. It’s not only the\\nright thing to do; it makes good business sense too.\\n\\nA McKinsey associate and his ED went to interview a middle-level\\nmanager at a large pharmaceuticals company that the Firm was\\nhelping to restructure. The man had been with the company for 20\\nyears; now he was terrified that McKinsey would get him fired.\\nWhen the consultants came into his office, he was sweating bullets.\\nAfter introductions were made, he asked the consultants if they\\nwould like some coffee; he had a Mr. Coffee on his credenza. He\\nwent to pick up the pot to pour, but he couldn’t; his hands were\\n\\n\\x0cConducting Interviews\\n\\n87\\n\\nshaking too much. He put the pot down and tried again—still no\\ngood. Finally, he had to place the rim of the cup hard against the\\nbrim of the pot to get the coffee out.\\n\\nI offer this story to show just how unsettling an interview can\\nbe. As the interviewer, someone who is investigating a business\\nproblem, you carry power and authority. Not over a CEO or a top-\\nlevel manager perhaps, but over many others. Imagine what you\\nrepresent to, say, a store manager whose boss told her to talk to', 'believe you have a professional responsibility to respect the inter-\\nviewee’s anxiety, to allay it, and not to take advantage of it.\\n\\nRespecting the interviewee’s anxiety means not leaving him\\nfeeling naked at the end of the interview, as if he’s been the sub-\\nject of a military interrogation. Remember that you’re looking for\\njust two or three things in any interview. You shouldn’t need to\\nsqueeze an interviewee dry to get them. Also, be circumspect about\\nasking questions that, though perfectly appropriate in a business\\ncontext, may touch on deeply personal matters from the inter-\\nviewee’s  perspective.  For  example,  your  first  question  should \\nprobably not be “So, what is it that you do, exactly?”\\n\\nAllaying the fears of interviewees means demonstrating how\\nthe process benefits them—not just the interview, but the whole\\nprocess of solving the organization’s problems. If you make their\\njob  more  efficient,  that  should  benefit  them.  Likewise,  if  you\\nimprove the profitability of their employer, that might work to\\ntheir advantage too. Don’t be afraid to offer a quid pro quo. Inter-\\nviewees are giving you information; if you have information that', 'more about what is going on in their organization.\\n\\nNot taking advantage of the interviewee’s fears means resist-\\ning the temptation to use the power of the interview as a blunt\\ninstrument. Most of the time, an interviewee is willing to help.\\n\\n\\x0c88\\n\\nWorking to Solve Business Problems\\n\\nThere is no need, in the first instance, to flash your authority like\\na police badge. If you do that, you may find that, like a gangster\\nin an old cops and robbers movie, the interviewee “clams up.”\\nIf you run into real obstruction or hostility (see the next section),\\nyou may have to bring your authority into play, but not until\\nthen. Along with power comes the responsibility to use it wisely. \\n\\nDIFFICULT INTERVIEWS\\nConduct enough interviews and you will encounter difficult\\nones. Some of them are easy enough to handle, once you\\nknow how. Others will test your strength and spirit.\\n\\nA major New York brokerage house, worried that it was lagging\\nits  rivals  in  profitability,  called  in  McKinsey  to  do  a  complete\\nreview of its many businesses. The stakes for the company and its\\nexecutives were high; the prospect of mass firings loomed. The var-', 'McKinsey camps and promoted their agendas vigorously. \\n\\nHamish McDermott, a newly promoted EM, had scheduled a\\nmeeting with one of the broker’s senior managers and his manage-\\nment team. He walked into the man’s office and introduced him-\\nself. The man replied, “Hamish McDermott, eh? You’re the ———\\nthat’s been telling the board I’ve been refusing to meet my cost\\nreduction target.”\\n\\nSometime in your career, if you aggressively pursue solutions to\\nbusiness problems, you will run into a situation like Hamish’s.\\nHow  do  you  handle  this  kind  of  outright  hostility  in  an  inter-\\nviewee? Here’s how Hamish did it:\\n\\n\\x0cConducting Interviews\\n\\n89\\n\\nHis words were pretty shocking to me, especially since they\\nweren’t true. But I didn’t get angry and I didn’t back down.\\nI simply explained that I thought he was mistaken and said\\nthat we still had to have our meeting.\\n\\nHe did it partly because he was a difficult guy and partly\\nto see if we would back down. If someone says something\\nblatantly false like that, you have to challenge him; you can’t\\nback down. ', 'This strategy worked very well for us. Afterwards several\\nof his staff came and apologized that we had been insulted in\\nthis way. They thought we had handled it with a great deal\\nof dignity and strength; we established credibility with a\\nnumber of important people in the organization, and that\\nhelped us later on.\\n\\nThe limits to this strategy are the limits of your authority in\\nthe organization. McKinsey consultants usually have the back-\\ning of the top management at the client and can thus stand up to\\nanyone. If you aren’t so favored, just remember that if the per-\\nson you are interviewing is more senior than the person who\\nauthorized your project, you will probably have to back down\\nwhen challenged.\\n\\nA less hostile, but equally difficult situation arises when inter-\\nviewees refuse to give you information. They won’t answer your\\nquestion or give you access to relevant documents or data. When\\nthis happens, it is time to “pull rank.” If you’re there asking them\\nquestions,  then  someone  in  your  organization  (or  your  client)\\nwants you to be there. Let them know that. If they still refuse, play\\nhardball. If necessary, call the boss on the phone there and then.', 'information floodgates. You’re not in the schoolyard any longer;\\nno one will call you a tattletale.\\n\\n\\x0c90\\n\\nWorking to Solve Business Problems\\n\\nYou may also encounter difficulty when interviewing what psy-\\nchiatrists might call the passive-aggressive type, but I like to call\\n“the Sandbagger.” Sandbaggers will talk all you want; they just\\nwon’t tell you anything, as one former McKinsey EM found out:\\n\\nI walked into this woman’s office—we had blocked out an\\nhour for the interview—and she told me that she could give\\nme  only half an hour. She then proceeded to talk for the next\\n30 minutes about what she thought McKinsey did and why\\nit was that McKinsey was there. When she ran out of steam\\non that topic, she told me the story of her life. I couldn’t get\\na word in edgewise.\\n\\nHandling a Sandbagger requires an indirect approach. Often\\nthe most useful strategy is finding someone else in the organization\\nwho can tell you what you want to know. If the Sandbagger is the\\nonly source for the information, then you may have to ask her boss\\nto have a quiet word with her.\\n\\nThe last category of difficult interview is also the hardest to', 'to face with someone who knows your work will likely get him\\nfired—and you know it too. Unfortunately, there is very little you\\ncan do in such cases apart from playing the “good soldier.” You\\nhave to do your job, and you have to get the interviewee to help\\nyou. It’s for the good of the organization. You can’t become angry\\nor upset, despite the unfairness of it all. In a way, there is no effec-\\ntive strategy. You just have to reach down inside yourself and push\\non through. No one ever said life was fair.\\n\\n\\x0cConducting Interviews\\n\\n91\\n\\nALWAYS WRITE A THANK-YOU NOTE\\nWhen you get back to your office after interviewing some-\\none, take the time to write a thank-you letter. It’s polite and\\nprofessional, and could pay you back in unexpected ways.\\n\\nIf your mother was like my mother, then when you were a kid you\\nwere always told to write a thank-you note after you received a\\ngift. I have a large extended family, so after holidays and birth-\\ndays I spent what seemed like weeks writing letters to aunts and\\nuncles and second cousins thanking them for whatever it was they\\nhad sent me, whether I liked it or not. My mom would always be', 'reading them and checking my penmanship). I didn’t realize it\\nthen, but this proved good training for my time at the Firm.\\n\\nAfter you’ve taken half an hour or more out of someone’s day\\nto interview and get information from him, you should take the\\ntime  to  thank  him  in  writing.  As  my  mom  could  tell  you,  it’s\\npolite. It shows that you value the interviewee’s time as much as\\nhe  does.  It’s  also  professional.  Sending  someone  a  few  choice\\nwords below your corporate letterhead puts your company in \\na favorable light.\\n\\nMy  mom  taught  me  to  avoid  boilerplate  thank-you  notes.\\n“Dear ———, thank you for the ———. I will always cherish it”\\nwas unacceptable when I was a boy. It’s still unacceptable today.\\nThat doesn’t mean each thank-you note you write needs to be a\\ngem of immaculately crafted prose. Just make sure it doesn’t read\\nlike a computer-generated form letter. I keep the text of a basic\\nthank-you note on my hard drive; when I need to write one, I alter\\nit to suit each particular recipient. It takes a few extra seconds, but', '\\x0c92\\n\\nWorking to Solve Business Problems\\n\\nit’s worth it. It’s also much easier than it was when I was 13, and\\nhad to write all those thank-you notes by hand.\\n\\nSometimes a thank-you note can yield an unexpected payoff.\\nEvery new McKinsey-ite hears the story of the associate who needs\\nto interview a senior sales executive at an agricultural products\\ncompany somewhere in America’s heartland. When he calls the\\nman saying he’s from McKinsey and would like an hour of his\\ntime, he receives an effusive welcome from the other end of the\\nline. “Come on down,” he is told. When the associate arrives after\\na long journey, the man shows him a letter on McKinsey stationery,\\nfrom another McKinsey associate, thanking the executive for his\\ntime on a day 15 years in the past. The letter has pride of place on\\nthe man’s office wall, along with his college diploma, hanging in \\na frame.\\n\\nSometimes a little politeness goes a long way.\\n\\n\\x0c9\\n\\nBRAINSTORMING\\n\\nABOUT BRAINSTORMING AT MCKINSEY\\n\\nWhen the study has been sold, the team assembled, and the\\npreliminary research done, the real work can begin. Brain-', 'the clients really buy. Let’s face it. Most large, modern cor-\\nporations are chock full of intelligent, knowledgeable man-\\nagers who are darned good at day-to-day problem solving.\\nMcKinsey offers a new mindset, an outsider’s view that is not\\nlocked into “the company way” of doing things. That’s what\\nclients need when problems cannot be solved within the orga-\\nnization, and it starts in a meeting room with a table, some\\nchairs, a bunch of pads, pens and pencils, some markers, and\\na clean “white board.”\\n\\nBefore the first brainstorming session, McKinsey consul-\\ntants do their homework. Everyone on the team reads the\\nresults of the PDNet and library searches. The associates put\\ntogether and distribute “fact packs” based on their prelimi-\\nnary research. The ED, the EM, and possibly the more senior\\nassociates on the team come up with initial hypotheses that\\nthe team will then test to destruction.\\n\\nBrainstorming takes time. Typically, a McKinsey team\\nblocks out two hours, if not more, for a brainstorming ses-\\nsion.

I even recall some teams bringing in\\na six-pack or two of beer for a weekend session (presumably\\nto stimulate the flow of ideas). McKinsey’s U.S. offices keep\\n“menu books” of the favored local food delivery services;\\nthese books see a lot of use.\\n\\nThe most important ingredient for successful brainstorm-\\ning  is  a  clean  slate.  There’s  no  point  calling  a  meeting  if\\nyou’re just going to look at the data in the same old way. You\\nhave to leave your preconceptions and prejudices at the door\\nof the meeting room. That way, you are free to manipulate\\nthe facts in your mind. \\n\\nI like to think of brainstorming as playing with that old\\npuzzle Rubik’s Cube. Each fact is a face on one of the small\\ncubes. Turn the faces this way and that, and you’ll come up\\nwith the answer, or at least an answer. \\n\\nAnother  metaphor  I  like  to  use  is  shuffling  a  pack  of', 'the  cards  are  in  order.  How  boring.  Shuffle  the  cards,  or\\nthrow them into the air and see how they land. Now you\\nmight find some interesting patterns: straights, flushes, full\\nhouses. The same thing happens when you toss around facts\\nand ideas.\\n\\nIn the next few lessons, we’ll take a closer look at the var-\\nious aspects of brainstorming à la McKinsey, and learn a few\\ntips to make your brainstorming more productive. \\n\\n\\x0cBrainstorming\\n\\n95\\n\\nPROPER PRIOR PREPARATION\\nAlthough  brainstorming has an airy-fairy, college bull ses-\\nsion connotation to some, in reality effective brainstorming\\nrequires some hard-nosed advance work.\\n\\nThe cardinal rule of brainstorming is that you cannot do it success-\\nfully in a vacuum. Before you go into that meeting, you have to\\nknow something about the problem you’ll be working on. Don’t\\njust stride into the meeting expecting to wow everyone with your\\nbrilliance. As with all things McKinsey, there is a method to prepar-\\ning for your brainstorming session, whether you are the leader (or,\\nas some prefer, moderator or facilitator) or just a participant.', 'If you have followed the outline of Part Two sequentially—that\\nis, you’ve completed your research—then half your preparation is\\ndone already. Now make sure that everyone on the team knows\\nwhat you know. Put your research into what McKinsey-ites call a\\n“fact pack,” a neatly organized summary of the key points and\\ndata that you’ve discovered, and circulate it to your team. If you\\nare the leader, make sure that all your team members put their\\nresearch into fact packs. Making a fact pack is easy. It doesn’t\\nrequire a detailed structure, just a little thought about what is\\nimportant and how to show it. Once everyone on the team has\\nread all the fact packs, you’ll all have the same knowledge base\\nwhen it comes time to generate ideas. \\n\\nOnce you have absorbed your team’s fact base, what next?\\nMcKinsey-ites fall into two camps on this subject. The first group\\nsays, “Familiarize yourself with the outlines of the problem and \\nthe data. Don’t try to come up with an answer before the session\\nstarts.” The counterproposition states, “Always come in with a\\n\\n\\x0c96\\n\\nWorking to Solve Business Problems\\n\\nhypothesis; otherwise, you waste too much time flailing around', 'tions—they’re both right. If you can come up with a hypothesis,\\nfine; if you’re the team leader, you probably ought to have one. Just\\ndon’t march into the team room saying, “This is the answer.” The\\nright attitude is, “I think this may be how things are. Let’s attack\\nthis hypothesis as a group.”\\n\\nYou can also prepare by brainstorming on your own, ahead of\\ntime. Rather than come up with a single hypothesis, get an idea of\\nthe likely set of hypotheses that your team will come up with—the\\nsolutions that fit within the scope of your project. You can then\\nquickly dismiss hypotheses that are unrealistic, while giving your\\nteam  free  rein  to  work  on  ideas  that  are  more  plausible.  This\\napproach keeps your brainstorming grounded in reality, which, as\\none former McKinsey director observed, is all that is out there.\\n\\nHowever  you  go  about  it,  just  make  sure  that,  at  the \\nvery least, you know the facts. Remember the Boy Scout motto: \\n“Be prepared.”\\n\\nIN A WHITE ROOM\\nThe point of brainstorming is the generation of new ideas. So', 'into the room, leave your preconceptions at the door. Bring\\nthe facts you know, but find new ways of looking at them.\\n\\nIn the last section, I suggested that you spend a few hours on your\\nown, knocking around the facts and devising a set of hypotheses.\\nNow I’m going to recommend that you come into the brainstorm-\\n\\n\\x0cBrainstorming\\n\\n97\\n\\ning meeting without any preconceptions. If that seems contradic-\\ntory to you, well brainstorming benefits from a few contradic-\\ntions—provided they help stimulate your thinking.\\n\\nAgain, brainstorming is about generating new ideas. If all the\\nteam members come into the room saying the same old things and\\nagreeing with one another, then you’ve gained nothing and wasted\\ntime. Even worse, if the team leader comes in and imposes her view\\non everyone else, the team has missed an opportunity to achieve a\\nsolution that’s more creative and, possibly, better.\\n\\nBrainstorming requires the participation of everyone in the\\nroom, from the most senior director to the most junior analyst—\\nand there’s no guarantee on any given day that the former will have\\nbetter ideas than the latter. No one should be afraid to speak his\\nmind in the brainstorming room. So, along with your preconcep-', '\\nHere’s an example of how not to run a brainstorming session.\\nWhen  Kristin  Asleson  was  a  new  associate,  the  SEM  on  her\\nengagement called the team members in for a brainstorming ses-\\nsion. When they got there, the SEM said, “Just be quiet and watch\\nme work through the problem on the white board.” They then sat\\nthere for the next hour watching the SEM think to himself. It may\\nhave been instructive, but it wasn’t brainstorming, unless it was\\nbrainstorming as theater.\\n\\nHere  are  a  few  more  “rules  of  the  road”  for  successful\\n\\nbrainstorming.\\n\\nThere are no bad ideas. No one should ever hesitate to open\\nher mouth during a brainstorming session for fear of getting zinged\\nwith  the  words  “That’s  a  bad  idea.”  If  the  idea  was  sincerely\\nmeant, but you disagree with it, take a minute to explain why.\\nDebating ideas is part of the brainstorming process. Who knows?\\nAfter a few minutes of discussion it, it might not seem such a bad\\nidea after all. At least give it a chance. Obviously, ideas that are not', '\\x0c98\\n\\nWorking to Solve Business Problems\\n\\ndirected at the problem at hand don’t count—for example, “Let’s\\nforget about the problem and go play Frisbee” (unless you think\\nthe team might benefit from a quick game).\\n\\nThere are no dumb questions. Just as there are no bad ideas,\\nany question should be taken on its merits. Never be afraid to ask\\nwhy something is the way it is or is done the way it’s done. Often\\nthe answer is “Well, gee, that’s the way we’ve always done it”—\\nwhich is not a good reason to do much of anything. \\n\\nNever  discount  the  benefits  of  working  through  seemingly\\nobvious or simple questions. For example, when I was working\\non an engagement for a money management company, at our first\\nbrainstorming  meeting,  the  brand-new  associate  on  our  team\\nasked, “How much money is there in the world?” Rather than just\\nsaying “lots,” we spent the next 45 minutes thinking through the\\ndynamics of international money management and came out with\\nsome useful insights.\\n\\nBe prepared to kill your babies. This rather shocking notion\\noriginated among Hollywood screenwriters. It means that if your', 'end of the session, dispense with it. Look upon your hypothesis as\\njust one more datum to throw into the brainstorming mix. Offer\\nit up to your teammates and let them knock it around. It may be\\n“right” or it may be “wrong,” but the main thing is that it should\\nhelp the team think through the problem at hand. Don’t invest a\\nlot of your ego in your hypothesis; don’t come to the meeting pre-\\npared to die in a ditch defending it. \\n\\nKnow when to say when. Brainstorming takes time, but if you\\nstay  at  it  too  long,  you’ll  hit  the  point  of  rapidly  diminishing\\nreturns. The consensus among former McKinsey-ites is that a team\\ncan stand about two hours of brainstorming before the atmosphere\\ndeteriorates. In my opinion, this time frame is especially true of\\nevening sessions. Unless the team is composed completely of night\\n\\n\\x0cBrainstorming\\n\\n99\\n\\nowls, people become tired, cranky, and slow off the mark as the\\nnight wears on. There are always exceptions, of course. Sometimes\\nyou get on a roll and the adrenaline keeps you productive until well', 'colleague’s plate of leftover fried rice. In general, though, it’s best\\nto call a halt before the team starts coasting. There’s always the\\nnext day, or the weekend.\\n\\nIf  you  must  hold  an  all-day  session,  you  have  to  make\\nallowances to keep the participants’ energy level up. Let conver-\\nsations go on tangents; allow people to make jokes and let off\\nsteam, but rein them in after a little while to keep them focused.\\nTake breaks every now and then—and not just for lunch, dinner,\\nand calls of nature. If you can take a half-hour walk somewhere,\\ndo so. It’s a great opportunity for people to gather their thoughts\\nand stretch their legs.\\n\\nGet it down on paper.\\n\\nUnlike a regular meeting, where some-\\none has the job of taking minutes, brainstorming doesn’t lend itself\\nto precise note taking. Ideas flit around the room like mayflies and\\ncan die just as quickly. You cannot, under any circumstances, leave\\nthe room and turn off the lights without a permanent record of\\nthe outcome. Don’t think that, in the rush of coming up with a bril-\\nliant idea, you’ll never forget it. Once the adrenaline wears off and', '\\nMcKinsey uses an excellent device to preserve the outcomes of\\nbrainstorming sessions. Although practically every meeting room\\nhas a white board and markers that wipe clean with an eraser or\\npaper towel, some have white boards that can make paper copies\\nof whatever is written on them. It’s an excellent way to get the\\nfinal copy of that brilliant idea or killer chart you sketched at \\n2 a.m.\\n\\nYou  can  duplicate  this  high-tech  marvel  with  low-tech\\nflipcharts. The only drawback to flipcharts is that marker ink on\\n\\n\\x0c100\\n\\nWorking to Solve Business Problems\\n\\npaper doesn’t erase—so be neat. At the end of the meeting, give\\nsomeone  the  job  of  transcribing  all  the  flipcharts  onto  regular\\npaper and circulating copies to the team.\\n\\nSOME BRAINSTORMING EXERCISES\\nThe key to successful brainstorming is good preparation\\nand a proper frame of mind. Here are a few tricks that\\nMcKinsey-ites use to get the maximum benefit from their\\nbrainstorming sessions.\\n\\nWhile Kristin Asleson was at the Firm, she took part in an experi-\\nmental  training  program  on  brainstorming,  during  which  she', 'storming seminar off to a good start.\\n\\nThe Post-itTM exercise. Give everyone in the room a pad of\\nsticky notes. The participants then write out any relevant ideas\\nthey have, one idea per note, and hand them over to the leader,\\nwho reads them aloud. This is a very good way to generate a lot\\nof ideas quickly without getting bogged down in discussing each\\none as it comes out.\\n\\nThe flipchart exercise. Put a number of flipcharts around the\\nroom, each one labeled with a different category or issue. Each team\\nmember then goes around the room writing ideas down on the\\nappropriate flipchart. If you like, you can give each team member\\na different colored marker, so you know whose ideas are whose.\\n\\nBellyaches up front. Kristin remembers a particularly effec-\\ntive method for handling large-scale brainstorming meetings in a\\ntense atmosphere:\\n\\n\\x0cBrainstorming\\n\\n101\\n\\nWe invited all the relevant players into a large room to dis-\\ncuss options for change at the client. We asked them to tell us\\nup front everything they didn’t like about the program we\\nhad presented. Once they had vented, we asked them to\\ncome up with things that were good about it, and ways that', 'this required some “tough love” from our ED. The tech-\\nnique worked in two ways: It yielded some excellent ideas\\nthat we would not have otherwise come up with; and it\\nhelped a previously skeptical, if not outright hostile, man-\\nagement team buy into McKinsey’s solution.\\n\\nOne more tip for handling a grumbler or rabble-rouser at a\\nbrainstorming session: Have the leader or moderator stand behind\\nhim, and even touch him on the shoulder occasionally. This lets the\\ntroublemaker know that he is being watched. If he mutters an\\naside,  the  moderator  can  ask  him  to  speak  up,  rather  like  the\\nteacher who tells the note-passing student, “Why don’t you share\\nit with the class?”\\n\\nTry these exercises to jazz up your own brainstorming sessions.\\n\\nYou’ll be impressed with the results.\\n\\n\\x0cThis page intentionally left blank.\\n\\n\\x0c(cid:2)\\n\\nPART THREE\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nTHE \\nMCKINSEY WAY\\nOF SELLING \\nSOLUTIONS\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nCopyright 1999 Ethan M.

They are where the rubber meets the road.\\n\\nA presentation reflects the thinking of the person or team that\\nput it together. If your presentation is sloppy and muddled, your\\naudience will assume that your thinking is also sloppy and mud-\\ndled—regardless of whether that is the case. So, whatever structure\\nyou applied to your thought process, apply it to your presenta-\\ntion. If you use the McKinsey structure, use it in your presentation.\\nIf you prefer some other organizing principle, make sure your pre-\\nsentation  reflects  it—assuming,  of  course,  that  your  thought\\nprocess is structured and logical. \\n\\nLet me reiterate that you do not have to use the McKinsey struc-\\nture if you are not comfortable with it—if it is not the way you\\nthink. A friend of mine at business school became an entrepreneur;\\nlike many entrepreneurs, he was capable of brilliant insights and\\nintuitive leaps, but his thinking was not particularly organized. He\\nmade many successful presentations using the basic structure of\\n“Tell ’em what you’re going to tell ’em, tell ’em, tell ’em what you', '\\nUsually, if you adhere to a structure that makes a step-by-step\\nprogression, you want the audience to follow your presentation\\nat your pace. There’s usually someone in the audience who lacks\\n\\n\\x0cMaking Presentations\\n\\n107\\n\\nthe patience for this. One McKinsey EM faced the problem of a\\nsenior manager at his client who, when handed a presentation doc-\\nument, would invariably leaf through it from beginning to end and\\nthen “tune out” for the rest of the meeting. But the EM found a\\nsolution. For his team’s final presentation, he handed the manager\\na blue book with all the pages stapled together—no more leafing.\\n\\nREMEMBER THAT THERE ARE DIMINISHING\\nMARGINAL RETURNS TO EFFORT\\nResist the temptation to tweak your presentation right up to\\nthe last minute. Weigh the value of a change against a good\\nnight’s sleep for you and your team. Don’t let the best be the\\nenemy of the good.\\n\\nMcKinsey-ites are bound together by a set of common experiences:\\ntraining programs, interviews, “all-nighters,” and more. One of\\nthe most common and most unnecessary experiences shared by\\nalmost every associate in the Firm is the 4 a.m. vigil in the copier', 'tomorrow’s (although now it’s today’s) big progress review. I once\\nspent a pleasant two hours early one morning removing one chart\\nfrom 40 spiral-bound copies of a blue book and replacing it with\\na new version, all because of one typo. Another associate and his\\nEM worked through the night cutting and pasting new numbers\\nonto a chart with razor blades and a glue stick (this was before\\ncomputer graphics became widely available at the Firm).\\n\\nMany  businesspeople  and  many  organizations  will  accept\\nnothing less than perfection. In many cases, this is laudable: No\\n\\n\\x0c108\\n\\nSelling Solutions\\n\\none wants to ride in an airplane where the engine mounting bolts\\nfit almost correctly. However, when you are preparing a presenta-\\ntion, even to the hardest-nosed CEO of the most powerful corpo-\\nration, don’t let the best be the enemy of the good. At some point,\\nusually well before the actual presentation, nitpicking changes no\\nlonger add value. Learn to recognize that point and draw the line\\non changes well in advance of the meeting.\\n\\nThink about it this way: What matters more, that your team\\ngets a good night’s sleep before the presentation or that there is a', 'have a few typos, no matter how hard you search and despite spell-\\nchecking software (or, sometimes, because of it). On rare occa-\\nsions, that typo may have to be corrected, but only rarely. Far\\nbetter that you come to the presentation rested, not harried and\\nbedraggled; giving a presentation is stressful enough as it is.\\n\\nDrawing the line on changes requires discipline. If yours is the\\nfinal say on the presentation, you just have to discipline yourself.\\nTell yourself and your team that you want the documents printed,\\ncopied, bound, or transferred onto slides—whatever it is that you\\nneed—at least 24 hours before the big moment. Spend the time\\nbetween then and the presentation rehearsing, discussing possible\\nquestions that may arise, or just taking a relaxed day at the office,\\nif you can.\\n\\nIf, as is the case for any EM at McKinsey, you put together the\\npresentation but someone senior to you (e.g., your ED) has the\\nfinal say on the document, then you have to manage upward as\\nstrongly as you can.

Your boss is\\nhere; your boss’s boss is here; the heads of all your company’s busi-\\nness units are here; your CEO is sitting at the head of the table\\nhanging on your every word. \\n\\nYou begin to speak. “Ladies and gentlemen,” you say, “after\\nweeks of exhaustive research, my team and I have reached the con-\\nclusion that the future of our company requires us to increase our\\ninvestment in widget production by 75 percent over the next two\\nyears.” As you reach for your first chart of backup analysis, a mur-\\nmur is heard from the audience. The director of the gadgets divi-\\nsion is incensed. Surely, he says, the future of the company lies with', 'level of funds available. The president of the widgets subsidiary\\nrushes to your defense. Your moment in the corporate sun dis-\\nsolves into a shouting match. Clearly, not everyone likes surprises.\\nTo avoid this disaster scenario, McKinsey consultants engage\\nin “prewiring.” Before they hold a presentation or progress review,\\na McKinsey team will take all the relevant players in the client\\norganization through their findings in private. That way, there are\\nfew, if any, surprises on the big day. As one former EM said, “It\\nwas very rare for us to do a presentation where we hadn’t taken the\\n\\n\\x0c110\\n\\nSelling Solutions\\n\\nvarious players through our findings beforehand. Otherwise, it was\\njust too risky. In effect, the actual presentation became perfor-\\nmance art.”\\n\\nWhen prewiring, you must remember the cardinal rule of being\\na successful consultant or corporate troubleshooter: Not only do\\nyou have to come up with the “right” answer; you also have to\\nsell that answer to your client. Sometimes, this just requires sales-\\nmanship; other times, it takes compromise. Suppose you walk into\\nthe office of Bob, the Director of the Gadgets Division, and tell him\\nthat  you  think  the  answer  is  to  invest  more  in  widgets,  at  the', 'alone with him in his office, you are far more likely to be able to\\ntake him through your analysis step by step. \\n\\nBy the end of the process, the gadgets director may be con-\\nvinced (great, move on to the next person) or he may come up\\nwith some fact you hadn’t known about that alters your recom-\\nmendation (which does happen, believe me), or he may refuse to\\naccept your recommendation without some changes. In the last\\ncase, you have to negotiate. If the compromise is small, make it\\nand move on; if his demands are too great, you will have to fig-\\nure out a way to bypass him. Of course, if he throws you out of his\\noffice (unlikely, but possible), you have a problem on your hands\\nthe size of which is in proportion to the director of gadgets’ power\\nin the organization.\\n\\nLet’s go back to our scenario at the beginning of this section.\\nThis time, though, imagine that you have prewired your presenta-\\ntion with all the senior managers at the table, including the unre-\\nlenting  director  of  gadgets.  “Ladies  and  gentlemen,”  you  say,\\n“after weeks of exhaustive research, my team and I have reached', 'increase our investment in widget production by 75 percent over\\nthe next two years.”  As you reach for your first slide, the direc-\\n\\n\\x0cMaking Presentations\\n\\n111\\n\\ntor of gadgets says, “I’ve heard this before, and it’s horse ———.\\nWe have to increase our gadget production.” The CFO raises an\\neyebrow, but says nothing—you’ve already shown him how he can\\nfund the additional investment. The SVP of the widget subsidiary,\\nsecure in the knowledge that she will be the winner at the end of\\ntoday’s presentation, merely looks in the direction of the CEO. The\\nCEO leans back in his chair, steeples his fingers, and tells the gad-\\ngets director: “Now come on, Bob, I think we’re all pulling on the\\nsame oar here. Let’s get through the presentation, then we can dis-\\ncuss it at the end.” You already know what that outcome will be.\\nIsn’t it better to skip the surprise ending?\\n\\n\\x0cThis page intentionally left blank.\\n\\n\\x0c11\\n\\nDISPLAYING DATA \\nWITH CHARTS\\n\\nABOUT CHARTS AT McKINSEY\\n\\nMcKinsey relies on charts, graphical representations of infor-\\nmation,  as  a  primary  means  of  communicating  with  its', 'cover what works with charts and what does not.

Use charts as a means of getting your\\nmessage across, not as an art project.\\n\\nWhen I started at the Firm, the first pieces of equipment I was\\nissued were a box of mechanical pencils, an eraser, and a set of\\nruled, plastic templates with cutouts for various shapes: circles,', 'plates,” I was told. “They’re expensive to replace and you’ll need\\nthem to draw your charts.” This was in 1989, hardly the Stone\\nAge, and for years I had been using computer graphics to draw\\ncharts and graphs in my previous jobs and at business school. It\\nstruck me as slightly primitive: evidence of a corporate culture that\\nwas inflexible in the face of advancing technology. \\n\\nI was partly right, for McKinsey’s culture is strong and thus\\nslow to change, but I was also partly wrong; those templates\\nserved  a  very  important  purpose:  to  keep  our  charts  simple.\\nComputer graphics make it too easy to get fancy. The Firm uses\\ncharts as a means of expressing information in a readily under-\\nstandable form. The simpler things are, the easier they are to\\nunderstand. Therefore, McKinsey prints its charts in black and\\nwhite; it avoids three-dimensional graphics unless absolutely nec-\\nessary to convey the message; and it adheres to the cardinal rule\\nof one message per chart. The first two strictures are visual. The\\nmedium must not overpower the message; hence the ban on dis-\\ntracting colors or deceptive 3-D perspectives. The rule of one', 'the audience. \\n\\n\\x0cDisplaying Data with Charts\\n\\n115\\n\\nThe information in a chart may be highly complex and expres-\\nsive of multiple points or ideas; the job of the chartist is to pick\\nwhich  point  to  make.  McKinsey  consultants  do  this  with  the\\n“lead,” the caption at the top of the chart. A good lead expresses\\nthe point of the chart in one simple sentence (see Figure 11-1). The \\nsalient information in the chart may be highlighted, with a differ-\\nent shading, an exploded pie slice, or (as I’ve done here) with an\\narrow, among other methods. If a chart offers several insights,\\ncopy it with a new lead and the relevant information highlighted\\n(see Figure 11-2). \\n\\nAlso, look in the lower left corner of either chart. You’ll see a\\nsource attribution. McKinsey charts always include one. Why? So\\nthat when people ask, “Where did you get this information?” you\\n\\nACME Widgets ran an operating loss last year\\nACME WIDGET CORPORATION INCOME STATEMENT 1998 \\n($US Millions)\\n150\\n–170\\n\\n–20\\n\\n18\\n\\n10\\n\\n–2\\n\\n6', 'Net Widget\\nSales\\n\\nOperating\\nExpenses\\n\\nEarnings\\nBefore\\nInterest \\nand Taxes\\n\\nInterest\\nIncome\\n(Net)\\n\\nSource: Acme Widget Corporation annual report.\\n\\nTaxes Net Income\\n\\nGain on\\nSale of\\nGadgets\\nSubsidiary\\n\\nFigure 11-1.

Asso-\\nciates can now draw their charts in PowerPointTM, and occasionally\\nyou’ll see a McKinsey chart with a bit of color.  But the Firm still\\nadheres to the admirable principle of simplicity.\\n\\n\\x0cDisplaying Data with Charts\\n\\n117\\n\\nUSE A WATERFALL CHART TO SHOW THE FLOW\\nThe waterfall chart—seldom seen outside McKinsey and not\\ngenerally  available  in  computer  graphics  packages—is  an\\nexcellent way to illustrate quantitative flows.\\n\\nWhen you looked at each sample chart in the last section, you\\nprobably wondered exactly what type of chart you were seeing. It\\nlooked something like a column chart, but not like any you’d find\\nin the chart libraries of Excel™, Freelance™, or any of the other\\npopular computer graphics packages. The chart may have looked\\nstrange, but I’ll bet you didn’t have a lot of trouble understanding\\nit. It’s called a waterfall chart, and McKinsey-ites use it all the time,\\nalthough it’s rarely found anywhere else.\\n\\nWhen I asked former McKinsey-ites what lessons they learned', 'They loved them, and sometimes used them in their own work,\\nbut seldom saw them elsewhere. In my modest ambition to make\\nthe world a better place, I herewith offer the secret of the water-\\nfall chart.\\n\\nThe waterfall chart is an excellent method of illustrating how\\nyou get from number A to number B. The charts in Figures 11-1\\nand 11-2 depict a simplified income statement, starting with sales\\non the left and ending with net income on the right, and show the\\nvarious items that lead from one to the other. The starting point\\n(sales in the example) is always a column that begins at zero. Pos-\\nitive items such as interest income are depicted as columns that\\nstart at the high point of the preceding column and reach upward.\\nNegative items such as operating expenses are columns that start at\\nthe high point of the preceding column and extend downward. The\\n\\n\\x0c118\\n\\nSelling Solutions\\n\\ntotal is the distance from the top of the last item (or bottom if that\\nitem is negative) to the zero line. Subtotals can be included along\\nthe way in the same manner. \\n\\nWaterfalls can depict static data (balance sheets, income state-\\nments) or active data (time series data, cashflows). You can mix', 'gained 3 in the first quarter, then lost 2 in the next quarter, for a\\ntotal of 7), or you can segregate them to show, say, where value is\\ncreated and where it is destroyed (e.g., we make money in wid-\\ngets, gadgets, and thingamajigs; we lose money in flummeries,\\nfrankincense, and myrrh). \\n\\nWhatever data you use, the waterfall chart is a versatile way\\nto convey a lot of information in a clear, concise manner. So go\\nwith the flow.\\n\\n\\x0c12\\n\\nMANAGING INTERNAL \\nCOMMUNICATIONS\\n\\nABOUT INTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS \\nAT McKINSEY\\n\\nThe success of a team-based operation depends on open com-\\nmunication, both from the top down and from the bottom\\nup. McKinsey has the same methods of internal communica-\\ntion as those available to any modern organization: voice\\nmail, e-mail, memos, meetings, the water fountain, and so\\nforth. It is fair to say that in the area of internal communica-\\ntions the Firm as a whole has no new insights to offer. On the\\nother hand, former McKinsey-ites, in their many combined\\nyears of experience, have garnered a number of useful meth-', '\\nCopyright 1999 Ethan M. Rasiel.

No matter which\\ndirection the manure is dumped, the Mushroom Method is unpro-\\nductive. For a successful team operation, you have to keep the\\ninformation flowing.\\n\\nMake sure your team is up to date with at least the broad out-\\nlines of your project. This is especially true of large undertakings.\\nBeing “in the loop” will help your teammates understand how\\ntheir work is contributing to the final goal, how their efforts are\\nworthwhile. Conversely, when people feel that they are working\\nin a vacuum, that they are alienated from the greater enterprise,', 'to date, they’ll return the favor. At the ground level, they may be\\ncloser to events than you are. Good information flow can help you\\nspot emerging problems (or opportunities) faster.\\n\\nAlways keep your boss up to date with your team’s progress.\\nDon’t think that your boss will stay out of your way if you keep\\nher in the dark. She’ll be far more comfortable when she knows\\nthat everything is under control. If things are not under control,\\nthen you want your boss to know exactly what the problems are so\\nshe can apply her expertise as effectively as possible.\\n\\nThere are two basic methods of internal communication: the\\n\\n\\x0cManaging Internal Communications\\n\\n121\\n\\nmessage (whether in the form of voice mail, e-mail, or memo) and\\nthe meeting. I’ll suggest some tips for successful messages in the\\nnext section. Right now, let’s concentrate on meetings.\\n\\nMeetings form the glue that holds your team together. Team\\nmeetings allow excellent information flow, in all directions, and\\nprovide a certain amount of social bonding. They help remind\\nthose present that they are part of a team. Suzanne Tosini, a former\\nMcKinsey EM and now a senior manager at Freddie Mac, noted\\nthat one of the keys to a successful meeting is making sure every-', 'ings a regular item on everybody’s schedule. If you have nothing\\nto discuss, then cancel the meeting (as far in advance as possible);\\nyour teammates can always find a use for the extra 45 minutes. \\n\\nSuzanne’s  other  two  keys  for  a  successful  meeting  are  an\\nagenda and a leader. Keep the number of items on your agenda to\\nthe minimum needed to make sure everyone is up to date with\\nimportant events, issues, and problems. If something can be put on\\nhold for another time, it probably should. If you are the leader,\\nmake sure you cover your agenda as briskly as possible: Frequent\\nmeetings are good, unnecessarily long ones are not.\\n\\nOne other method of internal communication is in a class by\\nitself: learning by walking around. Some of the most valuable con-\\nversations in my experience resulted from random encounters—in\\nthe corridors, at the water cooler, on the way to lunch, at the Firm,\\nor at the client. You can gain a lot just by wandering around and\\ntalking to people, and they can learn a lot from you. Never under-\\nestimate the value of the random fact. \\n\\nHowever you choose to communicate with your team, make', 'team’s efficiency and morale, as well as your boss’s peace of mind.\\nTurn on the lights and clear out the manure!\\n\\n\\x0c122\\n\\nSelling Solutions\\n\\nTHE THREE KEYS TO AN EFFECTIVE MESSAGE\\nA good business message has three attributes: brevity, thor-\\noughness and structure. Include all three in every voice mail,\\ne-mail or memo you send and you’ll get your message across.\\n\\nA message, whether it’s an e-mail, a voice mail, a memo, or a\\nsticky note covered in cramped handwriting, is a presentation in\\nminiature—a means of conveying information to an audience. As\\nsuch, an effective message shares the same properties as an effec-\\ntive presentation: It is brief, covering only the points the audience\\nneeds to know; it is thorough, covering all the points the audi-\\nence needs to know; and it has a structure that conveys those\\npoints clearly to its audience.\\n\\n1. Brevity. Brevity, or rather the lack of it, is much more of a\\nproblem in spoken than written communications. Many business-\\npeople can write concise memos, but how many can record a con-\\ncise voice mail? To join that select group, think before you speak', 'that the audience needs to know. If necessary, write these things\\ndown on paper. Some McKinsey-ites write the entire message out\\nlike a script before sending a voice mail to their ED or DCS. I think\\nthat’s going a bit too far—just the bullet points will do.\\n\\n2. Thoroughness. Make sure your message contains everything\\nyour audience needs to know. You are not trying to keep your audi-\\nence in suspense. Don’t just tell your boss, “I’m doing X, Y, and Z.\\nCall me if you have any questions.” Tell her not only what you are\\ndoing, but what the issues are and what your thoughts are on them.\\nDon’t just check in; it’s a waste of your boss’s time (and yours). If\\nyou don’t have anything useful to say, wait until you do.\\n\\n\\x0cManaging Internal Communications\\n\\n123\\n\\n3. Structure. To be readily understood, a message must fol-\\nlow a structure, and that structure must be readily apparent to the\\naudience. Even if you’re just writing a one-page e-mail or leaving\\na 30-second voice message, a simple structure will help your mes-\\nsage get through. It can be as basic as this:', 'We have three problems. In order of increasing impor-\\n\\ntance, they are:\\n\\n1. Our widgets are too expensive.\\n2. Our sales force is incompetent.\\n3. Our widget factory was just destroyed in a freak \\n\\nmeteorite impact.\\n\\nSometimes McKinsey-ites can take structuring their messages a\\nbit too far. One EM in the New York office was reputed to put her\\nshopping lists in Firm format. Another left affectionate messages on\\nhis wife’s answering machine—following the McKinsey structure.\\n\\nAlthough you needn’t follow the extreme examples of these\\noverzealous McKinsey-ites, in your business communications you\\nwould do well to remember the three keys to effective messaging.\\n\\nALWAYS LOOK OVER YOUR SHOULDER\\nYou cannot be an effective consultant if you don’t maintain\\nconfidentiality. Know when you can talk and when you can’t.\\nBe just a bit paranoid.\\n\\nDuring my first week at McKinsey, I went through a short orien-\\ntation course along with the rest of my Firm “classmates.” Dur-\\ning a seminar on confidentiality, the EM leading the discussion\\n\\n\\x0c124\\n\\nSelling Solutions\\n\\nmentioned that when he stayed over at his girlfriend’s apartment,\\nhe kept his briefcase locked. At the time, that struck me as a bit', 'trust? (OK, I was young and naïve at the time.) It was only after I\\nhad been at the Firm a bit longer that I realized quite how seriously\\nMcKinsey takes confidentiality.\\n\\nMcKinsey’s corporate culture continually reinforces confiden-\\ntiality. We always kept it in the back of our minds. If we were on\\na plane, we didn’t take client information out of our briefcases and\\nwork on it; we never knew who might be sitting next to us—a\\ncompetitor, a journalist, maybe even someone from your client. If\\nwe needed those three hours to work, it was our tough luck.\\n\\nWe never mentioned our clients by name outside the office,\\nand sometimes not even at the Firm. McKinsey often works for\\nmore than one client in an industry, so some information had to\\nbe kept even from fellow consultants. We often used code words\\nwhen discussing our clients, though not always successfully. One\\nEM from Germany recalled coming home to find a note from his\\ngirlfriend (who worked for a competing consulting firm) saying\\nthat the dinner for Code A (pronounced, in German, as “code\\nah”) would take place at a fancy Munich restaurant. In fact, the\\nname of the client company was Coda; the caller had used the', 'The EM was not pleased.\\n\\nYou may not need to maintain confidentiality while working\\non your business problem—then again, maybe you do. Ask your-\\nself a few simple questions: What would happen if you were sitting\\non an airplane and one of your competitors saw what you were\\nworking on? How about someone from your company who wasn’t\\ninvolved in the project? How about your boss? \\n\\nIf you’re working on something sensitive, take a few basic pre-\\ncautions. Don’t leave important papers lying around. Lock up your\\n\\n\\x0cManaging Internal Communications\\n\\n125\\n\\ndesk and file cabinets before you leave for the night. Don’t talk\\nabout the specifics of your work outside your team. (You can tell\\nyour significant other only if he or she doesn’t pose a security risk.)\\nDon’t take out sensitive material in public—sensitive means any-\\nthing that a competitor or journalist might find interesting. Be\\nmindful of what you say over the phone, and be extra careful when\\nsending faxes, e-mail, and voice messages: They can very easily end\\nup in the wrong hands.\\n\\n\\x0cThis page intentionally left blank.\\n\\n\\x0c13\\n\\nWORKING WITH CLIENTS\\n\\nABOUT WORKING WITH CLIENT TEAMS\\n\\nIt goes without saying that without clients there would be no', 'going. It is not, therefore, surprising that McKinsey-ites are\\nalways  told  to  put  the  client  first.  Hamish  McDermott\\nremarked that there was one true hierarchy at McKinsey:\\nclient, firm, you (in descending order).\\n\\nIn this chapter, we will cover the two different aspects of\\nworking with clients the McKinsey way. We will start with\\ntechniques to get the most out of a client team, the people\\nfrom the client organization who work with McKinsey to\\nreach a solution; we’ll also look at ways to keep a client\\nteam from doing more harm than good. We will then move\\non to managing the client—in McKinsey’s case, the senior\\npeople at the client organization who had called in the Firm\\nto  begin  with.  You  will  learn  how  to  keep  your  clients\\nengaged and supportive of your efforts and also how to\\nmake sure your solution actually gets implemented rather\\nthan gathering dust on a high shelf.\\n\\nFor some readers, the issue of client teams may seem\\nremote. After all, if you are not a consultant, when will you\\nactually  have  to  deal  with  client  teams?  The  answer  is', 'organization, you may find yourself working with a team\\nfrom, say, another business unit. Or you may be working\\n\\nCopyright 1999 Ethan M. Rasiel.

In  that  case,  you  will,  I  hope,  find  the \\ndiscussion of client teams as useful as the discussion of\\nmanaging your client.\\n\\n\\x0cWorking with Clients\\n\\n129\\n\\nKEEP THE CLIENT TEAM ON YOUR SIDE\\nWhen you’re working with a client team, you and the team\\nhave to work together or you won’t work at all. Make sure\\nthat members of the client team understand why their efforts\\nare important to you and beneficial for them.\\n\\nThe first thing to do when working with a client team is get them\\non your side. Make sure that they want to help you. At McKinsey,\\nwe learned that the key to keeping the client teams on our side was\\nto turn their goals into our goals. They have to remember that if\\ntheir mission fails, the McKinsey mission fails and if the McKinsey\\nmission fails, their mission fails. \\n\\nMembers of the client team must also realize that working with', 'to understand that, at a minimum, they’ll learn things that they\\nwould never otherwise know and that will help them in their careers.\\nThey’ll also have a chance to make real change happen in their orga-\\nnization—a rare experience in most people’s working lives.\\n\\nFor example, when I was working on a reorganization project\\nfor a Wall Street broker, my team worked with a client team made\\nup of people from the IT department. One particular member of\\nthe client team, whom I’ll call Morty, was a mainframe computer\\nprogrammer, and looked the part. He stood about five and a half\\nfeet tall, in his business shoes, wore thick glasses and a suit that\\nnever quite fit; he lived with his parents in Brooklyn. Morty didn’t\\nreally want to be on the client team; he had far too much “real”\\nwork to do. \\n\\nThen I took Morty with me on a few interviews. He got to\\nmeet  senior  people  in  his  organization:  bankers,  brokers  and\\n\\n\\x0c130\\n\\nSelling Solutions\\n\\ntraders—the people at the front end of the business. He got to\\nask them questions and find out what they thought his depart-', 'own skills to solve problems he would not usually see in his day-\\nto-day work. He also became noticeably more confident and out-\\nspoken during meetings as the study progressed. Working with\\nMcKinsey was an eye-opener for Morty, and he loved it (espe-\\ncially since he didn’t have to write the interview notes; that job\\nwas left to me).\\n\\nI’ll close this section with a final note on the subject, and an\\napparent contradiction of something I wrote earlier (see “A Little\\nTeam Bonding Goes a Long Way” in Chapter 5). Team-bonding\\nactivities really add value when working with client teams. Since \\nthe client team is not bound by the same shared experiences as the\\nMcKinsey team, a little social interaction between the two can make\\nworking together a lot easier. A trip to the ballpark or dinner at a\\ngood restaurant (when people put away their “office faces”) can help\\nthe members of each team realize that the others are real people too.\\n\\nHOW TO DEAL WITH “LIABILITY” CLIENT\\nTEAM MEMBERS\\nYou may find that not everyone on the client team has the\\nsame abilities or goals as you do. Get “liability” members off\\nthe client team if you can; otherwise, work around them.', 'There are two kinds of “liability” members on a client team: the\\nmerely useless and the actively hostile. Ideally, neither type is  on\\nyour team. If your career is typical, you’ll probably get both.\\n\\n\\x0cWorking with Clients\\n\\n131\\n\\nOn  an  engagement  for  a  large  New  York  bank,  my  team\\nworked with a client team staffed with senior managers from var-\\nious departments within the client organization: lending, investing,\\nback office, and so on. Our member from the back office was a\\nman I’ll call Hank. \\n\\nHank was, shall we say, a diamond in the rough. He stood 6\\'4\"\\ntall and looked like a former football player who had let himself\\ngo—which, in fact, he was. His ties never matched his shirts and he\\ninvariably had food stains on his suit coat. Also, Hank knew his\\narea of the bank inside and out and was probably as smart as any\\nmember of the McKinsey team. \\n\\nHank didn’t want to work with McKinsey. He thought that the\\nFirm peddled an expensive line of baloney to credulous clients and\\nleft the employees to clean up afterward He didn’t want to be on', 'him  to  the  team,  so  he  showed  up  every  day,  and  stubbornly\\nrefused to contribute. In short, Hank was useless.\\n\\nHow do you handle a Hank, or someone who is just too dumb\\nor incompetent to do the work required of him? As a first (and eas-\\niest) tactic, you can try to trade the liability out of your team and\\nget somebody better. \\n\\nTrading doesn’t always work, however; there might be no one\\nbetter available and you’re stuck with your own Hank. In that\\ncase, you have to deal with Hank. Work around him. Give him a\\ndiscrete section of the work that he can do; make sure it is neither\\ncritical to the project nor impossible for anyone else on the team to\\ndo. You’ll have to rely on the other members of the team pick up\\nthe slack.\\n\\nFor all his faults, Hank was better than Carlos. A superslick\\noperator (BA, Oxford; MBA, Harvard) from Argentina, Carlos\\nwas the leader of the client team and our main liaison with the\\nmost senior management at the client. He was also a saboteur. Car-\\n\\n\\x0c132\\n\\nSelling Solutions\\n', 'company that did not want McKinsey there; these board members\\nfelt they knew which direction McKinsey would recommend and\\nthey didn’t like it. \\n\\nCarlos subtly but actively prevented us from getting our job\\ndone. He sent us down blind alleys; he bad-mouthed us to the\\nboard behind our backs; he sabotaged us during presentations. We\\nquickly realized that Carlos was not our friend.\\n\\nHandling a Carlos, or any hostile client team member, is trick-\\nier than dealing with a Hank. Again, the best tactic is to trade the\\nsaboteur out of your team, but that’s usually not feasible. If you\\nhave a Carlos on board, it’s because someone powerful in the orga-\\nnization wants him there. The next best solution is to work around\\nspies and saboteurs. Make use of their talents where you can and\\nkeep sensitive information out of their hands when possible. If you\\nknow who is behind the spy, find out what the ring leader’s agenda\\nis—maybe you can use that to your advantage when it comes time\\nto sell your solution.\\n\\nIn our case, we had to leave Carlos to our ED, who had the\\npolitical  skill  and  muscle  to  handle  him.  Even  then,  Carlos', '\\nLiability clients needn’t be a disaster. Sometimes, you can\\neven polish the rough diamonds. In Hank’s case, after several\\nweeks of working together, we managed to bond him to the team\\nand got him to understand and, at least partially, buy into the\\nMcKinsey way of problem solving. In the end, he did contribute\\nto our solution.\\n\\n\\x0cWorking with Clients\\n\\n133\\n\\nENGAGE THE CLIENT IN THE PROCESS\\nIf the client doesn’t support you, your project will stall. Keep\\nyour clients engaged by keeping them involved.\\n\\nTo  succeed  as  a  management  consultant  or  a  business  trou-\\nbleshooter you must keep your client—be it your boss or the man-\\nagement  of  an  organization  that  has  hired  you  from  the\\noutside—engaged in the problem-solving process. Being engaged in\\nthe process means supporting your efforts, providing resources as\\nneeded,  and  caring  about  the  outcome.  With  engagement  thus\\ndefined, it is hard to imagine how any project could succeed with-\\nout an engaged client.\\n\\nThe first step in keeping your clients engaged is to understand\\ntheir  agenda.  Clients  will  support  you  only  if  they  think  your', 'may change over time. Frequent contact and regular updates—\\neven if it’s just by memo—will help you keep in touch with your\\nclients and keep your projects “top of mind” for them. Get on a\\nclient’s calendar up front. Schedule progress meetings with tenta-\\ntive topics; if you need to reschedule, do it later.\\n\\nEarly “wins” (see “Pluck the Low-Hanging Fruit” in Chapter\\n3) will generate enthusiasm for your project—the bigger, the better.\\nThey give your clients something to sink their teeth into and make\\nthem feel included in the problem-solving process. The long-run\\nreturns on your work will be much greater if your clients feel that\\nthey were involved in reaching the solution and that they under-\\nstood it, rather than being handed the solution neatly wrapped and\\ntied with pink ribbon.\\n\\nThis brings us to one of the ironies of consulting. If you are an\\n\\n\\x0c134\\n\\nSelling Solutions\\n\\noutside consultant, you will never get credit for your best work.\\nIf your solution is truly effective, the client organization will claim\\nit for its own. Suzanne Tosini saw that firsthand as an associate \\nat McKinsey:\\n\\nI developed a huge cashflow model that the client was going', 'on this project; it had been a Herculean effort. The client\\nteam members did some work on it, but essentially it was my\\nmodel. When the time came to roll out the model, at a train-\\ning program for the senior people in the acquisitions depart-\\nment, the client team members got up and talked about the\\nmodel that they developed. I was sitting in the back and I\\nthought, “Hey, that’s my model.” But then I realized that it\\nwas much better for them to think that it was theirs. It was\\nnot McKinsey’s model, it was not Suzanne’s model—it was\\ntheir model.\\n\\nIn truth, that’s not such a bad thing.\\n\\nGET BUY-IN THROUGHOUT THE \\nORGANIZATION\\nIf your solution is to have a lasting impact on your client, you\\nhave to get support for it at all levels of the organization.\\n\\nIf you come up with a brilliant solution, structure it logically,\\nand present it to your client with clarity and precision, then your\\njob is done and you can go home, right? Wrong! If you want to\\ncreate real change that has lasting impact, you must get accep-\\n\\n\\x0cWorking with Clients\\n\\n135\\n\\ntance for your solution from everyone in the organization that ', '\\nFor instance, suppose you tell your board of directors that they\\ncan boost widget profitability by reorganizing the widget sales\\nforce and streamlining the widget production process. Your argu-\\nment is compelling; the board ratifies your suggestion; champagne\\ncorks pop and cigars ignite. One slight hitch remains: What do the\\nsales force and the production-line workers think about all this?\\nIf they don’t like your ideas, if they put up a fight, then your solu-\\ntion will not be implemented. It will end up on the great remainder\\nshelf of business, right next to the Betamax.\\n\\nTo avoid this dire fate, you must sell your solution to every\\nlevel of the organization, from the board on down. After you’ve\\npresented to the board, present to middle-level managers. They will\\nprobably have day-to-day responsibility for implementing, so let\\nthem know what’s going on. Don’t neglect the people on the line,\\neither. The changes you recommend may have the greatest effect on\\nthem,  so  their  buy-in  is  vital  to  a  successful  implementation.\\nFinally, serial presentations give the junior members of your team\\na good opportunity to hone their presentation skills. \\n\\nTailor your approach to your audience. Don’t make the same', 'At the same time, respect your audience. Explain what is being\\ndone and why. Show people the entire picture. Let them know\\nhow their jobs fit into the organization as a whole. They’re not\\nstupid; they’ll understand. Treat them with respect (remember, a\\nlot of the time they don’t get any) and they will respond positively\\nmost of the time.\\n\\n\\x0c136\\n\\nSelling Solutions\\n\\nBE RIGOROUS ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION\\nMaking change happen takes a lot of work. Be rigorous and\\nthorough. Make sure someone takes responsibility for getting\\nthe job done.\\n\\nImplementing recommendations for change is a big subject. Whole\\nbooks can be (and have been) written on it. I will limit myself here\\nto explaining a few ground rules that McKinsey consultants have\\nlearned for implementing change.\\n\\nTo implement major change, you must operate according to a plan.\\nYour implementation plan should be specific about what will happen\\nand when—at the lowest possible level of detail. Don’t just write:\\n\\nWe must reorganize the widget sales force.\\n\\nInstead, write:\\n\\nWe must reorganize the widget sales force.\\n\\n• Hold training sessions for all sales regions (Start: March\\n\\n1. Responsibility: Tom.)\\n\\n• Reallocate sales staff to new sales teams by customer type.', '(Start: March 15. Responsibility: Dick.)\\n\\n• Take new sales teams to call on top 20 customers. (Start:\\n\\nApril 1. Responsibility: Harriet.)\\n\\nOne former EM gave a no-holds-barred recipe for a successful\\n\\nimplementation plan:\\n\\nState what needs to be done, and when it needs to be done\\nby, at such a level of detail and clarity that a fool can under-\\nstand it.\\n\\n\\x0cWorking with Clients\\n\\n137\\n\\nEnough said.\\nMake specific people responsible for implementing the solu-\\ntion. Be careful about whom you pick. Make sure people have the\\nskills necessary to get the job done. Enforce your deadlines and\\ndon’t allow exceptions unless absolutely necessary.\\n\\nThe right point person can make implementation a very smooth\\nprocess. If that person is not going to be you, make sure you pick\\nsomeone who can “kick butt and take names.” At one McKinsey\\nclient, an international bank, the managers chose a rather frighten-\\ning fellow named Lothar to implement a major change program in\\ntheir back-office processing. Lothar, who looked and sounded a bit\\nlike Arnold Schwarzenegger, had a very simple technique for getting\\nthe job done. Using the detailed McKinsey implementation plan,', 'the team would meet, and anybody who had not accomplished his\\nor her tasks for the period had to explain the failure to the entire\\ngroup. After the first meeting, when a few of the team members had\\nundergone a grilling from Lothar, no one ever missed a deadline.\\n\\nWhen, after a few months, the McKinsey EM rang Lothar for\\nan update, he replied, “Everyone talks about how tough it is to\\nimplement. Seems pretty easy to me.”\\n\\n\\x0cThis page intentionally left blank.\\n\\n\\x0c(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nPART FOUR\\n\\nSURVIVING\\nAT\\nMCKINSEY\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nCopyright 1999 Ethan M.

To make your\\nway through the corporate rain forest, it helps to have a guide,\\nsomeone more experienced than you who can show you the hidden\\ntracks and steer you clear of the quicksand. These days, the fash-\\nionable word for such a guide is mentor.\\n\\nMcKinsey maintains a comprehensive system of mentoring for\\nits client service staff. Every consultant, from analyst to director,*\\nis  assigned  a  mentor  to  monitor  and  guide  his  or  her  career', 'idea; it certainly seemed that way to me when, as an MBA, I was\\nconsidering whether to join McKinsey’s New York office.\\n\\nAs with so many wonderful ideas, the execution left a lot to\\nbe desired. I was assigned a mentor within my first week in the\\noffice, a very nice thirty-something partner. He bought me lunch at\\na trendy Italian eatery where supermodels popped in to nibble on\\narugula leaves. We talked about working at the Firm and how best\\nto climb its greasy pole to success; it was a pleasant and informa-\\ntive  45  minutes.  I  saw  him  once  after  that.  Within  about  six\\nmonths, he transferred to Mexico to open a new office for the Firm\\nsouth of the border. \\n\\nAfter that, I got lost in the shuffle for several months. Eventu-\\nally I was reassigned to another mentor. Although he had a good\\nreputation as a mentor, I was one of 9 or 10 “mentees” that he\\nhad, and I got very little out of the relationship beyond the pro\\nforma dissection of my performance reviews.\\n\\nSo, was I cast adrift in the Sea of McKinsey without a guide?', 'ceed in the Firm: I hitched my wagon to a star. I did most of my\\nwork with one ED, the same ED who recruited me into the Firm.\\n\\n*Actually, only the newer directors have mentors. In the case of the most senior directors,\\nthere is no one in the Firm to guide them. Rumors that certain senior DCSs have a direct\\nvideoconferencing line to a Higher Power can be safely dismissed. \\n\\n\\x0cFind Your Own Mentor\\n\\n143\\n\\nWe  had  a  good  relationship—call  it  chemistry.  When  I  needed\\nadvice I couldn’t get elsewhere, I went to him. He tried to get me\\nassigned to his teams on studies where I had expertise. I was con-\\nfident that, as long as I performed well for him, he would be in\\nmy corner when it came to assignments, reviews, and promotions. \\nMy experience was typical of most McKinsey-ites. How much\\nyou benefited from your official mentor was pretty much a matter\\nof luck. If you wanted guidance, you had to go out and get it.\\n\\nI believe that’s a lesson that applies in almost any large orga-\\nnization. Find someone senior to you whose abilities and opinion', 'advice and are happy to dispense it when asked. Of course, it helps\\nif you get along well too. Work with the mentor, if possible, and\\nlearn all you can. Don’t go to the well too often, however; you\\ndon’t want to become a pest.\\n\\nWhatever setup your organization has, make sure you find\\nyour own mentor. Having a guide you trust and respect will help\\nyou make it through your own corporate jungle.\\n\\n\\x0cThis page intentionally left blank.\\n\\n\\x0c15\\n\\nSURVIVING ON THE ROAD\\n\\nTraveling across the country (or the globe)\\ncan take a lot out of you.

Click here for Terms of Use.\\n\\n145\\n\\n\\x0c146\\n\\nSurviving at McKinsey\\n\\nAlthough working at McKinsey offers many advantages—good\\npay, interesting work, high-caliber colleagues—the working condi-\\ntions can be grueling. On top of the long hours, which routinely\\ninclude all-nighters, many McKinsey consultants spend most of\\ntheir time on the road, away from home, family, and friends. \\n\\nSometimes business travel for the Firm can be fun: a week in', 'Just as often, however, working out of town only adds to the grind.\\nThere is nothing quite so mind-numbing, as one former EM noted,\\nas the “If it’s Tuesday, this must be Davenport” cross-country trips\\na consultant has to make when visiting all of, say, a manufactur-\\ning company’s many plants across America. Even worse, you can\\nfind yourself commuting 1000 miles every Monday morning (or\\nSunday night) to some far-flung client, as happened to Hamish\\nMcDermott, who spent six long, cold months in Detroit working\\nfor one of the big car makers. That kind of travel takes a toll on\\nyour health, your relationships, and your sanity.*\\n\\nMcKinsey-ites have developed a number of ways to cope with\\nthe rigors of travel. They all agree on the importance of maintain-\\ning a proper attitude. Abe Bleiberg says:\\n\\nTry to look on business travel as an adventure. Even if I’m\\nstuck in Flint, Michigan for three months over the winter,\\nat least I can tell my grandchildren, “I survived a winter in\\nFlint.” Not everyone can say that.\\n\\nJason Klein adds:\\n\\nAct like a tourist. Make the most of where you are. If you’re', '\\n*On a personal note, I was a rare exception in that I spent only one night away from home\\nwhile working for clients. Most of my clients were New York–based financial firms, so my\\ncommute meant getting on the subway to Wall Street. Because of this, I was regarded by\\nmy far-flung associate “classmates” with a certain amount of jealousy; on the other hand,\\nI missed out on all those frequent-flyer miles.\\n\\n\\x0cSurviving on the Road\\n\\n147\\n\\ntake an afternoon and play Pebble Beach. You can keep your\\nnose to the grindstone for only so long.\\n\\nRemember that travel is an opportunity to do things outside\\n\\nyour normal realm of experience. Here’s Abe Bleiberg again:\\n\\nTraveling as much as I did for McKinsey enabled me to meet\\npeople  whom  I  would  never  otherwise  have  met.  For\\ninstance, I once worked on a project where, in one meeting,\\npeople  sat  around  a  table  trying  to  market  toilet  tissue.\\nNever in a million years would I have ever been involved in\\nselling toilet paper! It’s not something I’d want to dedicate\\nmy life to, but that’s part of the fun of working at the Firm.', 'Another key to surviving on the road: proper planning. If pos-\\nsible, schedule your time at the client to make sure you are at home\\non Fridays or Mondays. Pack light; learn what you need to have\\nwith you on the road, rather than what you think you need. If you\\ncan help it, fly with hand luggage only; just don’t assume the air-\\nline will let you take that extra carry-on bag. If you’re going to be\\nin one place for a long time, find out if the hotel has a room where\\nyou can store your extra bags when you leave for the weekend—\\nand make sure it’s not the employee smoking room (as Adam Gold\\nlearned the hard way!). Find a reliable cab company. If you’re rent-\\ning a car, make sure you have clear and accurate directions to your\\ndestination. Otherwise, you might find yourself, as once happened\\nto Hamish McDermott, coming off the interstate and onto the\\nmeanest of Detroit’s mean streets with no on-ramp in sight (that’s\\nthe sort of adventure you can do without).\\n\\nDon’t let the travel and the work become all-consuming, espe-\\ncially if you’re out of town for a long time. Find a way to enter-', 'members, or maybe old friends from business school or college to\\n\\n\\x0c148\\n\\nSurviving at McKinsey\\n\\nhave dinner with and catch a show or a ball game. At the very\\nleast, when you get back to the hotel do something before you go\\nto sleep—whether it’s working out, reading, or just watching tele-\\nvision. Don’t let being on the road become an uninterrupted cycle\\nof working, eating and sleeping.\\n\\nFor one final survival tip I am indebted to Eric Hartz, now\\n\\npresident of Security First Network Bank. He says:\\n\\nTreat everyone with tremendous respect. Sometimes McKin-\\nsey people can be demanding and impatient; then they fail to\\nunderstand why they don’t get what they want. Some of my\\ncolleagues were amazed at how I would get upgraded, or\\nwould get a bag on after the plane was full—things like that.\\nFlight attendants, concierges, assistants at clients—these peo-\\nple have more authority than you realize and want to help\\nthose who show respect for them. It also keeps your stress\\nlevel down—it’s easier to be friendly than frustrated—so it’s\\na win/win.\\n\\nThat’s possibly the best advice in this book.\\n\\n\\x0c16\\n\\nTAKE THESE THREE THINGS', 'YOU GO\\n\\nNarrow your traveling needs down to the \\nvery few things you must have with you\\nwhen you leave.

Since, as I’ve said before, things at McKinsey usually come\\nin threes, I asked the former McKinsey-ites I interviewed what\\nthree things they always have with them when they travel. \\n\\nHere are some of the answers grouped by category (after all,\\nthis  is  a  McKinsey  list),  along  with  explanatory  notes,  where\\nappropriate. \\n\\nClothing\\n• An extra shirt or blouse', '• Spare pair of comfortable flat shoes for the women\\n• Casual clothes\\n• Workout clothes (“It’s easy to let your fitness slide when \\n\\nyou’re on the road.”)\\n\\n• A cashmere sweater for keeping warm and comfy on \\n\\novernight flights.\\n\\nTools\\n• A writing pad \\n• A pad of graph paper (for hand-drawing charts)\\n• A copy of whatever you sent to the client \\n• An HP 12C calculator (“Better than a Swiss Army knife, \\n\\nalthough not quite as impressive on a date.”)\\n\\nPersonal Care Items\\n• A toothbrush \\n• A shaving kit for the men\\n\\n\\x0cTake These Three Things with You Wherever You Go\\n\\n151\\n\\n• A mini-makeup kit for the women\\n• Antacid tablets\\n• A bottle of Tylenol \\n• A big bottle of Tylenol\\n\\nThings to Keep You Organized and in Touch\\n• A personal organizer \\n• Credit cards (“I keep them in a separate wallet.”)\\n• The OAGTM (or other airline time table)\\n• A cell phone (“If I forget anything, I can just have it faxed.”)\\n• Directions to the client (so you don’t end up in the wrong \\n\\npart of Detroit)\\n\\nDiversions\\n• A good book ', '• Books on tape, especially if your travel includes long \\n\\nstretches of driving\\n\\n• Video games on a laptop computer\\n\\nThe prize for the oddest answer has to go to a former McKin-\\nsey-ite from the Düsseldorf office who listed Coca-Cola.

I can now drink Coke warm,\\ncold, or hot without blinking.”) Perhaps that belongs under per-\\nsonal care. \\n\\nIf these answers have a common theme, it’s “be prepared.”\\nMake sure you’re never caught short without something you really\\nneed. That being the case, the prize for the best three items goes\\nto a former associate in the Washington, DC office (who justifiably\\nwishes to remain anonymous). Our hero spent much of his time\\nconsulting in Brazil, where the weather, among other things, is\\nunpredictable.

Like any large\\norganization, McKinsey would fall apart were it not for an efficient\\ncadre of secretaries to handle the myriad administrative duties that\\nthe consultants are unavailable, unwilling or—frankly—unable to\\ndo. When consultants are on the road for much of the time, their\\nsecretaries are the lifeline that ties them to the rest of the Firm.\\n\\nTo attract the best, the Firm provides a real career path for secre-\\ntaries. New recruits usually start out working with four or five asso-\\nciates. The good ones move on to work for SEMs; the best get claimed\\nby partners and directors. Secretaries receive regular training, just like\\nconsultants, and they even get their own “retreat” every year. But\\nthere’s more to the path than that.

These range from the obvious, such\\nas typing, filing, and duplicating, to the not-so-obvious: filling out\\ntime sheets, paying credit card bills for consultants on long assign-\\nments, and sending flowers to significant others after yet another\\nmissed date. In fact, it is the less obvious tasks that really make a dif-\\nference in a consultant’s life. Most McKinsey-ites can do their own\\ntyping, many handle their own filing, and anyone can run the copier\\nin a pinch. But knowing that there is someone “back home” whom\\nyou can trust to do those other, niggling little things that you would\\nnormally do if you were not 500 miles from your apartment for the\\nnext six months—that’s going to make your life easier!\\n\\nThe alternative is pretty ugly.

Here’s how it finds them (and how', '\\nCopyright 1999 Ethan M. Rasiel.  Click here for Terms of Use.\\n\\n157\\n\\n\\x0c158\\n\\nSurviving at McKinsey\\n\\nOne of McKinsey’s goals, as listed in its mission statement, is “to\\nbuild a firm that is able to attract, develop, excite, motivate, and\\nretain exceptional people.” The first stage in reaching that objec-\\ntive is recruiting the best possible candidates to join the Firm. As\\nI’ve written elsewhere, McKinsey tries to skim off the cream, the\\nelite of the elite at the top business schools, as well as law schools\\nand economics and finance graduate programs. The Firm also goes\\nout of its way to recruit “nontraditional” candidates from outside\\nthe realms of business academia: doctors, scientists, and politi-\\ncians, among others.\\n\\nBecause the Firm takes recruiting so seriously, it commits seri-\\nous resources to it—probably more, proportionately, than any\\nother  business  organization.  Every  top  business  school,  for\\ninstance, has its own team of McKinsey consultants assigned to it,\\ncomplete with its own charge code for expenses. The expenses can\\nadd up too—sending four consultants from New York to Philadel-', 'taking  out  dozens  of  MBAs  to  fancy  restaurants  doesn’t  come\\ncheap. Furthermore, the EM on the team makes recruiting a full-\\ntime commitment; at McKinsey’s hourly rate, that represents a very\\nlarge opportunity cost! \\n\\nEven on a small scale, McKinsey doesn’t pinch pennies. When\\nKristin Asleson took a highly courted JD-MBA out to lunch in\\nNew York, she took her to Le Cirque. Ivana Trump held court\\nat a rear corner table. Walter Cronkite walked in. They nodded\\nto  each  other.  As  Kristin  recalls,  “We  both  thought  that  was\\npretty cool.”\\n\\nWith all this heavy weaponry, the Firm hunts first and fore-\\n\\nmost for analytical ability. As one former recruiter told me:\\n\\nI always looked for analytical thinkers, people who could\\nbreak apart problems into their components. I wanted evi-\\n\\n\\x0cRecruiting McKinsey Style\\n\\n159\\n\\ndence  that  they  knew  how  to  structure  problems.  I  also\\nlooked  for  business  judgment,  the  sense  that  the  person\\nknew the implications of his solutions. That’s why I always', '\\nCases are the weapon of choice in a McKinsey interview. They\\nrange  from  the  prosaic—stripped-down  versions  of  actual \\nMcKinsey  cases—to  the  whimsical  or  even  weird.  Examples:\\n“How many gas stations are there in the United States?” “Why are\\nmanhole covers round?”*\\n\\nIn a case interview, the interviewer wants to see how well the\\ninterviewee can think about a problem, rather than how correctly\\nshe answers it. As with most business problems, there is no one\\ntrue answer. Rather, succeeding in a case interview requires break-\\ning the problem into its component pieces, asking relevant ques-\\ntions, and making reasonable assumptions when necessary.\\n\\nFor instance, when figuring out the number of gas stations in the\\nUnited States, you might start by asking how many cars there are\\nin the country. The interviewer might tell you the number, or might\\nsay, “I don’t know. You tell me.” Well, you say to yourself, the pop-\\nulation of the US is about 275 million. If the average household size\\n(including singles) is, you guess, 2.5 people, than your trusty calcu-', 'nods in agreement. You recall hearing somewhere that the average\\nhousehold has 1.8 cars (or was that children?), so the United States\\nmust have 198 million cars. Now, if you can only figure out how\\n\\n*When I was joining the Firm, one of my interviewers posed this challenge: “You’ve just\\nbeen appointed special assistant to the Mayor of New York City. He wants to know how\\nto make New York a better place. What do you tell him?” Being a native Bostonian, I could\\nhave said a lot of things (first of all, get rid of the Yankees and the Mets), but I concen-\\ntrated on breaking the problem into its components. It worked.\\n**You never know when you might need your calculator! (See Chapter 16.)\\n\\n\\x0c160\\n\\nSurviving at McKinsey\\n\\nmany gas stations it takes to serve 198 million cars, you’ll have the\\nproblem solved. What matters is not the numbers, but the method\\nyou use to reach them. When I was asked this question in an inter-\\nview, I was off by a factor of 3, as the interviewer later told me, but\\nit didn’t matter for the purpose of testing my analytical ability.', 'There’s more to the successful would-be McKinsey-ite than just\\nanalytical ability, however. McKinsey consultants work in teams,\\nso personality counts too. As Abe Bleiberg put it:\\n\\nI assumed that most of the people who made it into the inter-\\nview process were smart enough to work at the Firm. So I\\ntried to answer the question: Did I really want to work with\\nthis person? Quite often, I rejected superintelligent, nasty\\npeople.  One  of  the  great  joys  for  me  was  saying,  “He’s\\nincredibly brilliant, and I wouldn’t have him on my team for\\na million bucks.”\\n\\nBeyond a candidate’s fit with the interviewer, there is also a\\ncandidate’s fit with the Firm. To discover that, the interviewer has\\nto get beyond the résumé and penetrate the polish. Given how slick\\nmany candidates are, the process can be tough. \\n\\nFor  instance,  Hamish  McDermott  met  with  one  would-be\\nMcKinsey-ite from Harvard Business School. Hamish tried the typ-\\nical opening interview gambit: “So, tell me a bit about yourself.”\\nHarvard Man proceeded to give a very structured, prepared, and', 'Knowing that he was hearing a script, Hamish interrupted him\\nwith a question. “How would you characterize your analytical\\nabilities?” he asked. Not wishing to break the flow of his mono-\\nlogue, Harvard Man replied, “I’ll get back to that question in 10\\nminutes.” As Hamish recalls, “That was not the response I was\\nlooking for.” Oddly enough, Harvard Man did not get an offer to\\njoin the Firm.\\n\\n\\x0cRecruiting McKinsey Style\\n\\n161\\n\\nNo doubt, many of you want to know how to get a job at\\nMcKinsey. The answer is simple: Be of above average intelligence,\\npossess a record of academic achievement at a good college and a\\ntop business school, show evidence of achievement in all previous\\njobs, and demonstrate extraordinary analytical ability. Simple to\\nsay, but not simple to do. \\n\\nIf you manage to clear all those hurdles, the key to your joining\\nthe Firm may be the case interview. I’ve already talked about cases,\\nbut I’ll leave you with the best description of how to handle a case,\\ncourtesy of Jason Klein:\\n\\nI always asked the same case.

My girlfriend\\n(now my wife) worked as a portfolio strategist in the same build-\\ning as my client, and she had a schedule just as punishing as mine.\\nMany times during the five months of that study we shared a cab\\nride home—at 2 a.m.!\\n\\nWhen I asked former McKinsey-ites how they left room for a\\nsocial life, many of them replied that they didn’t. As one of them\\ntold me, “I didn’t do a good job of it because I didn’t make enough', 'learned (if only in hindsight) was that if you want a life when you\\nwork crazy hours, then you have to lay down some rules.\\n\\nHours of discussion with former McKinsey-ites have yielded\\n\\nthree rules for a better life while at the Firm.\\n\\n• Make one day a week off-limits. Pick a day—most people \\ntake Saturday or Sunday—and tell your boss (and yourself)\\nthat you never work on that day unless it’s an absolute \\nemergency. Most bosses (at least in my experience) will \\nrespect that most of the time. Make sure that you respect \\nit too. Spend that day with your friends, your family, or \\njust the Sunday papers. Keep your mind off work and \\nrelax a bit.\\n\\n• Don’t take work home. Keep work and home separate. If \\nyou need to stay at the office for another hour, that’s better\\nthan coming home and ignoring your kids because you still\\nhave work to do. Home should be a place where you can \\nbe yourself.\\n\\n• Plan ahead. If you travel during the workweek this is the \\n\\nmost important rule. Don’t come back from the airport on \\na Friday night and expect to find stuff to do over the week-\\nend. When you’re out of town, you’re out of sight and out ', '\\x0cIf You Want a Life, Lay Down Some Rules\\n\\n165\\n\\nof mind, especially when you’re single. If you want to do \\nanything more than curl up with a good book, then you \\nhave to arrange things in advance. \\n\\nRules offer the great advantage of letting everyone know what\\nto expect—your boss, your significant other, your kids, and you.\\nOf course, it can sometimes be difficult to stick to even these very\\nbasic rules. When your priorities are “client, Firm, you,” some-\\ntimes you have to let your life take a backseat to your career. That\\nleads to my final rule:\\n\\n• When all else fails, have a doorman.
